[Transcriber's Notes]<br>
<br>
Obvious spelling errors have been corrected. I have not reconciled the<br>
variety of spellings of names and other words. Obvious factual errors,<br>
typographical errors, discoveries made after 1892, and contemporary<br>
(2008) theories and use of words are noted in the text within square<br>
brackets. I have not researched and checked every assertion by the<br>
author.<br>
<br>
This book was published 5 years before discovery of the electron. See<br>
the labored and completely inaccurate explanations of aurora and<br>
"energy, atomic". The author and his contemporaries were like fifteenth<br>
century sailors. They had a good idea of their latitude and direction<br>
(Ampere, Kirkoff, Maxwell, Gauss, Faraday, Edison, &#8230;), but only the<br>
vaguest notion of their longitude (nuclear structure, electrons, ions).<br>
Altitude (special relativity, quantum theory) was not even imagined.<br>

PREFACE<br>
<br>
The purpose of this work is to present the public with a concise and<br>
practical book of reference, which it is believed will be appreciated in<br>
this age of electricity. The science has expanded so much that the<br>
limits of what may be termed strictly a dictionary of the present day<br>
would a few years ago have sufficed for an encyclopedia. It follows that<br>
an encyclopedia of electricity would be a work of great size. Yet a<br>
dictionary with adequate definitions, and kept within the closest limits<br>
by the statement of synonyms, and by the consigning of all the<br>
innumerable cross-references to a concise index will be far more than a<br>
mere dictionary in the ordinary sense of the term.<br>
<br>
Duplication of matter is to be avoided. This makes many definitions<br>
appear short. Yet, by the assistance of the reader's own general<br>
knowledge, and by referring to the very complete index, almost any<br>
subject can be found treated in all its aspects. There are exceptions to<br>
this statement. So much has been done in the way of mechanical detail,<br>
so many inventions in telegraphy and other branches have sprung into<br>
prominence only to disappear again, or to be modified out of<br>
recognition, that to embody descriptions of many ingenious and<br>
complicated apparatus has been absolutely impossible for want of space.<br>
<br>
A word as to the use of the book and the system of its construction may<br>
be given here. Each title or subject is defined once in the text. Where<br>
a title is synonymous with one or more others the definition is only<br>
given under one title, and the others appear at the foot of the article<br>
as synonyms. It may be that the reader is seeking the definition of one<br>
of these synonyms. If so a reference to the index shows him at once what<br>
page contains the information sought for. The use of an index in a work,<br>
necessarily of an encyclopedic form, will be appreciated by all users of<br>
this book.<br>
<br>
vi&nbsp;&nbsp; PREFACE.<br>
<br>
Where a title embraces several words, all orders of the words will be<br>
cited in the index. To make the operation of finding references easy<br>
this rule has been carried out very fully.<br>
<br>
It is customary to regard electricity as a growing science. It is<br>
unquestionably such, but the multiplication of terms and words is now<br>
not nearly so rapid as it has been, and the time for the compiling of a<br>
work of this character seems most propitious. It is hoped that the<br>
public will indulgently appreciate the labor it has entailed on all<br>
concerned in its production.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Absolute.</span> adj.<br>
In quantities it may be defined as referring to fixed units of quantity,<br>
and it is opposed to "relative," which merely refers to the relation of<br>
several things to each other. Thus the relative resistance of one wire<br>
may be n times that of another; its absolute resistance might be 5 ohms,<br>
when the absolute resistance of the second wire would be 5/n ohms. A<br>
galvanometer gives absolute readings if it is graduated to read directly<br>
amperes or volts; if not so graduated, it may by "calibration" q. v. be<br>
made to do practically the same thing.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Absolute Temperature.</span><br>
Temperature reckoned from absolute zero (see "Zero, Absolute"). It is<br>

<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Absorption, Electric.</span><br>
A property of the static charge. When a Leyden jar is being charged it<br>
dilates a little and the capacity increases, so that it can take a<br>
little more charge for a given potential difference existing between its<br>
two coatings. This phenomenon occurs with other static condensers,<br>
varying in degree with the dielectric. With shellac, paraffin, sulphur<br>
and resin, for instance, the absorption is very slight; with<br>
gutta-percha, stearine, and glass, the absorption is relatively great.<br>
The term is due to Faraday. Iceland spar seems almost or quite destitute<br>
of electric absorption.<br>

The rate of change of velocity. If of increase of velocity it is<br>
positive; if of decrease, it is negative. It can only be brought about<br>
by the exercise of force and is used as the measure of or as determining<br>
the unit of force. It is equal to velocity (L/T) imparted, divided by<br>
time (T); its dimensions therefore are L/(T^2). The c. g. s. unit of<br>
acceleration is one centimeter in one second.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Accumulator, Electrostatic.</span><br>
Two conducting surfaces oppositely placed, and separated by a<br>
dielectric and arranged for the opposite charging of the two surfaces,<br>
constitute an accumulator, sometimes termed a condenser. As this<br>
arrangement introduces the element of a bound and of a binding charge,<br>
the electrostatic capacity of such is greater than that of either or of<br>
both of its component surfaces. The thinner the dielectric which<br>
separates the conducting surfaces, and the larger the surfaces the<br>
greater is the capacity; or the less will be the potential difference<br>
which a given charge will establish between its two coatings. The nature<br>
of the dielectric also determines its capacity. (See Capacity, Specific<br>
Inductive.)<br>

<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Accumulator, Water Dropping.</span><br>
This is also known as Sir William Thomson's Water-Gravity Electric<br>
Machine. It is an apparatus for converting the potential energy of<br>
falling water drops, due to gravity, into electric energy. Referring to<br>
the illustration, G represents a bifurcated water pipe whose two faucets<br>
are adjusted to permit a series of drops to fall from each. C and F are<br>
two metallic tubes connected by a conductor; E and D are the same. Two<br>
Leyden jars, A and B, have their inner coatings represented by strong<br>
sulphuric acid, connected each to its own pair of cylinders, B to D and<br>
E, and A to F and C. The outer coatings are connected to earth, as is<br>
also the water supply. One of the jars, say A, is charged interiorily<br>
with positive electricity. This charge, C and F, share with it, being in<br>
electric contact therewith. Just before the drops break off from the jet<br>
leading into C, they are inductively charged with negative electricity,<br>
the positive going to earth. Thus a series of negatively excited drops<br>
fall into the metal tube D, with its interior funnel or drop arrester,<br>
charging it, the Leyden jar B, and the tube E with negative electricity.<br>
This excitation causes the other stream of drops to work in the converse<br>
way, raising the positive potential of F and C and A, thus causing the<br>
left-hand drops to acquire a higher potential. This again raises the<br>
potential of the right-hand drops, so that a constant accumulating<br>
action is kept up. The outer coatings of the Leyden jars are connected<br>
to earth to make it possible to raise the potential of their inner<br>
coatings. In each case the drops are drawn by gravity into contact with<br>
objects similarly excited in opposition to the electric repulsion. This<br>
overcoming of the electric repulsion is the work done by gravity, and<br>
which results in the development of electric energy.<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Acidometer.</span><br>
A hydrometer or areometer used to determine the specific gravity of<br>
acid. They are employed in running storage batteries, to determine when<br>
the charging is completed. (See Areometer.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Aclinic Line.</span><br>
A terrestrial element; the locus on the earth's surface of no<br>
inclination of the magnetic needle; the magnetic equator. (See Magnetic<br>
Elements.)<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Acoustic Telegraphy.</span><br>
The system of sound-reading in telegraphy, universally used in the Morse<br>
system. The direct stroke of the armature of the electro-magnet and its<br>
"back stroke" disclose to the ear the long and short strokes, dots and<br>
lines, and long and short spaces as produced by the dispatcher of the<br>
message. In the Morse system a special magnet and armature is used to<br>
produce the sound called the "sounder;" in other systems, e. g.,<br>
Steinheil's and Bright's apparatus, bells are used. (See Alphabets,<br>
Telegraphic.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Acoutemeter.</span><br>
A Hughes audiometer or sonometer applied to determining the quality of a<br>
person's hearing (See Hughes' Induction Balance,--Audiometer). The<br>
central coil by means of a tuning fork and microphone with battery<br>
receives a rapidly varying current tending to induce currents in the<br>
other two coils. Telephones are put in circuit with the latter and pick<br>
up sound from them. The telephones are applied to the ears of the person<br>
whose hearing is to be tested. By sliding the outer coils back and forth<br>
the intensity of induction and consequent loudness of the sounds in the<br>
telephones is varied. The position when the sounds grow so faint as to<br>
be no longer audible, gives the degree of delicacy of the person's<br>
hearing. By using a single telephone the same apparatus affords a means<br>
of testing the relative capacity of the right and left ears.<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Actinic Rays.</span><br>
The rays of light at the violet end of the spectrum; also the invisible<br>
rays beyond such end, or the ether waves of short periods which most<br>
strongly induce chemical change.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Actinism.</span><br>
The power possessed by ether waves of inducing chemical change, either<br>
of decomposition or of combination. The violet and ultra-violet end of<br>
the spectrum of white light, generally speaking, represent the most<br>
highly actinic rays.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Actinometer, Electric.</span><br>
Properly an apparatus for measuring the intensity of light by its action<br>
upon the resistance of selenium. A current produced by fixed<br>
electro-motive force passing through the selenium affects a galvanometer<br>
more or less according to the intensity of the light. It is more<br>
properly an electric photometer. The term has also been applied to a<br>
combination of a thermo-electric pile and galvanometer, the light<br>
falling on the pile affecting the motions of the galvanometer.<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Action, Local.</span><br>
(a) The wasteful oxydation of the zinc in a galvanic battery due to<br>
local impurities and variations in the composition of the zinc. These<br>
act to constitute local galvanic couples which cause the zinc to<br>
dissolve or oxydize, without any useful result. Amalgamation of the zinc<br>
prevents local action. Chemically pure zinc is also exempt from local<br>
action, and can be used in an acid battery without amalgamation. (See<br>
Amalgamation.)<br>
<br>
(b) The same term has been employed to indicate the eddy or foucault<br>
currents in dynamo electric machines. (Sec Current, Foucault.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Activity.</span><br>
The rate of doing work; the work done per second by any expenditure of<br>
energy. The activity of a horse-power is 550 foot lbs. per second, or<br>
746 volt-coulombs per second. The practical electric unit is the<br>
volt-ampere, often called the watt. (Sec Energy, Electric.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Adapter.</span><br>
A screw coupling to engage with a different sized screw on each end; one<br>
of the uses is to connect incandescent lamps to gas-fixtures.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A. D. C.</span><br>
Abbreviation for Anodic Duration Contraction, q. v.; a term in<br>
electro-therapeutics.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Adherence, Electro-magnetic.</span><br>
The adherence between surfaces of iron due to elcctro-magnetic<br>
attraction. It has been applied to the driving-wheels of an engine and<br>
rail, whose grip is increased by such action. In one method a deep<br>
groove was cut around the wheel which was wound with a magnetizing coil.<br>
Thus one rim becomes a north and the other a south pole, and the rail<br>
completing the circuit acts as the armature. Such an arrangement<br>
prevents a wheel from sliding. Electro-magnetic adherence has also been<br>
employed to drive friction gear wheels. In one arrangement the two<br>
wheels are surrounded by a magnetizing coil, under whose induction each<br>
attracts the other, developing high adherence between their peripheries.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Admiralty Rule of Heating.</span><br>
The British Admiralty specifications for the permissible heating of<br>
dynamos. It holds that at the end of a run of six hours no part of the<br>
dynamo under trial shall show a rise of temperature greater than
11&ordm; C.<br>
(20&ordm; F.) above the temperature of the air surrounding it. This is<br>
thought to be a very stringent and unnecessarily high requirement.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Aerial Conductor.</span><br>
An electric conductor carried from housetops, poles, or otherwise so as<br>
to be suspended in the air, as distinguished from an underground or<br>
submarine conductor.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Affinity.</span><br>
The attraction of atoms and in some cases perhaps of molecules for each<br>
other by the force of chemical attraction. When the affinity is allowed<br>
to act or is carried out, a chemical change, as distinguished from a<br>
physical or mechanical change, ensues. Thus if sulphur and iron are each<br>
finely powdered and are mixed the change and mixture are mechanical. If<br>
slightly heated the sulphur will melt, which is a physical change. If<br>
heated to redness the iron will combine with the sulphur forming a new<br>
substance, ferric sulphide, of new properties, and especially<br>
characterized by unvarying and invariable ratios of sulphur to iron.<br>
Such change is a chemical one, is due to chemical affinity, is due to a<br>
combination of the atoms, and the product is a chemical compound.<br>

<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Agonic Line.</span><br>
The locus of points on the earth's surface where the magnetic needle<br>
points to the true north; an imaginary line determined by connecting<br>
points on the earth's surface where the needle lies in the true<br>
geographical meridian. Such a line at present, starting from the north<br>
pole goes through the west of Hudson's Bay, leaves the east coast of<br>
America near Philadelphia, passes along the eastern West Indies, cuts<br>
off the eastern projection of Brazil and goes through the South Atlantic<br>
to the south pole. Thence it passes through the west of Australia, the<br>
Indian Ocean, Arabia, the Caspian sea, Russia and the White sea to the<br>
North Pole. It crosses the equator at 70&deg; W. and 55&deg; E.
approximately.<br>

pressure is taken as 1. It is practically of exactly the same<br>
composition in all places and hence can be taken as a standard. When dry<br>
it has high resistance, between that of caoutchouc and dry paper.<br>
Dampness increases its conductivity.<br>
<br>
It is a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen, with a little carbonic acid gas<br>
and other impurities. Its essential composition is:<br>

The specific gravity of air under standard conditions 15.5&deg; C
(60&deg; F.)<br>
and 760 mm. barometric pressure (30 inches) is taken as unity as a<br>
standard for gases.<br>
<br>
[Transcriber's note: Argon accounts for 0.9340%. It was discovered in<br>
1894, two years after this book.]<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Air-Blast.</span><br>
(a) In the Thomson-Houston dynamo an air-blast is used to blow away the<br>
arc-producing spark liable to form between the brushes and commutator.<br>
It is the invention of Prof. Elihu Thomson. The air is supplied by a<br>
positive action rotary blower connected to the main shaft, and driven<br>
thereby. The wearing of the commutator by destructive sparking is thus<br>
prevented.<br>
<br>
A drum H H is rotated, being mounted on the axis X of the dynamo. As it<br>
rotates the three vanes are thrown out against the irregular shaped<br>
periphery of the outer case T T. The arrow shows the direction of<br>
rotation. The air is thus sent out by the apertures a a. O is the<br>
oil-cup.<br>
<br>
(b) The air-blast has also been used by Prof. Thomson in experiments<br>
with high frequency currents of high potential. By directing a blast of<br>
air against a spark discharge between ball terminals of an alternating<br>
current, the nature of the current was changed and it became capable of<br>
producing most extraordinary effects by induction.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Air Condenser.</span><br>
A static condenser whose dielectric is air. The capacity of an air<br>
condenser in farads is equal to<br>
&nbsp; A / ( 4.452E12 * t )<br>
in which A is the area of one sheet or sum of the areas of one set of<br>
connected sheets in square inches and t is the thickness of the layer of<br>
air separating them.<br>
<br>
A convenient construction given by Ayrton consists in a pile of glass<br>
plates P separated by little bits of glass F of known thickness, three<br>
for each piece. Tin-foil T is pasted on both sides of each piece of<br>
glass and the two coatings are connected. The tin-foil on each second<br>
plate is smaller in area than that on the others. The plates are<br>
connected in two sets, each set comprising every second plate. For A in<br>
the formula the area of the set of smaller sheets of tin-foil is taken.<br>
By this construction it will be seen that the glass does not act as the<br>
dielectric, but only as a plane surface for attachment of the tin-foil.<br>
Posts E E keep all in position. One set of sheets connects with the<br>
binding post A, the other with B.<br>
<br>
The capacity of any condenser with a dielectric of specific inductive<br>
capacity i is given by the formula:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ( i *A^1 ) / ( 4.452E12 * t1 )<br>
<br>
The air condenser is used for determining the value of i for different<br>
dielectrics.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Air Gaps.</span><br>
In a dynamo or motor the space intervening between the poles of the<br>
field magnet and the armature. They should be of as small thickness, and<br>
of as extended area as possible. Their effect is to increase the<br>
magnetic reluctance of the circuit, thereby exacting the expenditure of<br>
more energy upon the field. They also, by crowding back the potential<br>
difference of the two limbs, increase the leakage of lines of force from<br>
limb to limb of the magnet.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Air Pump, Heated.</span><br>
It has been proposed to heat portions of a mercurial air pump to secure<br>
more perfect vacua, or to hasten the action. Heating expands the air and<br>
thus produces the above effects.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Air Pump, Mercurial.</span><br>
An air pump operated by mercury. The mercury acts virtually as the<br>
piston, and the actuating force is the weight of the column of mercury,<br>
which must exceed thirty inches in height. There are many types.<br>
Mercurial air pumps are largely used for exhausting incandescent lamp<br>
chambers. (See Geissler Air Pump,--Sprengel Air Pump.)<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Air Pumps, Short Fall.</span><br>
A mercurial air pump in which the fall of mercury or the height of the<br>
active column is comparatively small. It is effected by using several<br>
columns, one acting after the other. A height of ten inches for each<br>
column suffices in some forms. Enough columns must be used in succession<br>
to make up an aggregate height exceeding 30 inches.<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Alarm, Burglar.</span><br>
A system of circuits with alarm bell extending over a house or<br>
apartments designed to give notice of the opening of a window or door.<br>
As adjuncts to the system the treads of the stairs are sometimes<br>
arranged to ring the bell, by completing a circuit when trod on. Door<br>
mats are also arranged to close circuits in like manner.<br>
<br>
<br>
17&nbsp; STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.<br>
<br>
<br>
For doors and windows switches are provided which are open as long as<br>
the door or window is closed, but which, on being released by opening<br>
the door or windows, automatically close the circuit. The circuit<br>
includes an alarm bell and battery, and the latter begins to ring and<br>
continues until stopped, either by the closing of the door or by a<br>
switch being turned. The connections are sometimes so contrived that the<br>
reclosing of the door or window will not stop the bell from ringing.<br>
<br>
The cuts show various switches for attachment to doors and windows. It<br>
will be seen that they normally keep the circuit closed, and that it is<br>
only open when pressure, as from a closed door, is brought upon them. In<br>
the case of a door a usual place for them is upon the jamb on the hinge<br>
side, where they are set into the wood, with the striking pin<br>
projecting, so that as the door is closed the pin is pressed in, thus<br>
breaking the circuit.<br>
<br>
Sometimes the connections are arranged so as to switch on the electric<br>
lights if the house is entered. Special annunciators showing where the<br>
house has been entered are a part of the system. A clock which turns the<br>
alarm on and off at predetermined hours is also sometimes used.<br>
<br>
The circuits may be carried to a central station or police station. One<br>
form of burglar alarm device is the Yale lock switch. This is a contact<br>
attached to a Yale lock which will be closed if the wrong key is used,<br>
completing a circuit and ringing a bell.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Alarm, Electric. </span><br>
An appliance for calling attention, generally by <br>
ringing a bell. It is used to notify of water-level in boilers or
tanks, <br>
of entrance of a house, or of other things as desired. It is evident <br>
that any number of alarms could be contrived.<br>
<br>
<br>
18&nbsp;&nbsp; STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Alarm, Fire and Heat.</span><br>
An alarm for giving notice of the existence of a conflagration. Such are<br>
sometimes operated by a compound bar thermostat (see Thermostat), which<br>
on a given elevation of temperature closes a circuit and rings an<br>
electric bell. Sometimes the expansion of a column of mercury when<br>
heated is used. This, by coming in contact with one or two platinum<br>
points, completes a circuit, and rings the bell.<br>
<br>
The identical apparatus may be used in living rooms, greenhouses.<br>
factories and elsewhere, to give an alarm when the temperature rises or<br>
falls beyond predetermined limits.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Alarm, Overflow.</span><br>
An alarm to indicate an overflow of water has been suggested on the<br>
lines of a contact completed by water, or of the elements of a battery<br>
which would be made active by water. Thus two sheets of metal might be<br>
separated by bibulous paper charged with salt. If these sheets were<br>
terminals of a circuit including a bell and battery, when water reached<br>
them the circuit would be closed and the bell would ring. It was also<br>
proposed to use one copper and one zinc sheet so as to constitute a<br>
battery in itself, to be thrown into action by moisture. These contacts<br>
or inactive batteries could be distributed where water from an overflow<br>
would be most likely to reach them.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Alarm, Water Level.</span><br>
An alarm operated by a change of water level in a tank or boiler. By a<br>
float a contact is made as it rises with the water. Another float may be<br>
arranged to fall and close a contact as the level falls. The closing of<br>
the contacts rings an electric bell to notify the attendant in charge.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Alcohol, Electrical Rectification of.</span><br>
A current of electricity passed through impure alcohol between zinc<br>
electrodes is found to improve its quality. This it does by decomposing<br>
the water present. The nascent hydrogen combines with the aldehydes,<br>
converting them into alcohols while the oxygen combines with the zinc<br>
electrode.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Alignment.</span><br>
The placing in or occupying of the same straight line. The bearings of a<br>
shaft in dynamos, engines, and other machinery have to be in accurate<br>
alignment.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Allotropy.</span><br>
The power of existing in several modifications possessed by some<br>
substances, notably by chemical elements. Instances of the allotropic<br>
state are found in carbon which exists as charcoal, as graphite<br>
(plumbago or black lead), and as the diamond. All three are the same<br>
elemental substance, although differing in every physical and electrical<br>
property.<br>
<br>
<br>
19&nbsp;&nbsp; STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Alloy.</span><br>
A mixture, produced almost universally by fusion, of two or more metals.<br>
Sometimes alloys seem to be chemical compounds, as shown by their having<br>
generally a melting point lower than the average of those of their<br>
constituents. An alloy of a metal with mercury is termed an amalgam. An<br>
important application in electricity is the use of fusible alloys for<br>
fire alarms or for safety fuses. German silver is also of importance for<br>
resistance coils, and palladium alloys are used for unmagnetizable<br>
watches. An alloy of wrought iron with manganese is almost<br>
unmagnetizable, and has been proposed for use in ship building to avoid<br>
errors of the compass.<br>
<br>
Alloys or what are practically such can be deposited by electrolysis in<br>
the electro- plater's bath. We give the composition of some alloys<br>
interesting to the electrician.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Alphabet, Telegraphic.</span><br>
The combinations of sounds, of dots and dashes marked on paper, of<br>
right-hand and left-hand deflections of a needle, of bells of different<br>
notes, or of other symbols by which a fixed combination is expressed for<br>
each character of the alphabet, for numerals, and for punctuation. While<br>
the code is designed for telegraphic uses it can be used not only for<br>
the conveyance of signals and messages by the electrical telegraphs, but<br>
also by any semaphoric or visual system, as by flashes of light,<br>
movements of a flag or even of the arms of the person signalling.<br>
<br>
In the English and continental needle telegraphy in which the message is<br>
transmitted by the movements of an index normally vertical, but<br>
oscillating to one side or the other under the influence of the current,<br>
the latter being controlled by the transmitter of the message, the left<br>
hand swings of the needle are interpreted as dots, the right hand as<br>
dashes.<br>
<br>
This system enables one alphabet to be translated into the other, or<br>
virtually one alphabet answers for both Morse and needle transmitters.<br>
<br>
There are two principal telegraphic alphabets, the American Morse and<br>
the International codes. They are very similar, their essential<br>
distinction being that spaces are used in the American code, while they<br>
are excluded from the International code.<br>
<br>
In the American Morse system the message is now universally received by<br>
sound. (See Sounder--Sound Reading.)<br>

23&nbsp; STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Alternating. adj. </span><br>
Term descriptive of a current changing periodically in<br>
direction. (See Current, Alternating.)<br>
<br>
Synonyms--Oscillatory--periodic--undulatory--harmonic.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Alternating Current Arc.</span><br>
The arc produced by the alternating current. It presents several<br>
peculiarities. With an insufficient number of alternations per second it<br>
goes out. As the carbons wear away equally it is adopted for such lamps<br>
as the Jablochkoff candle, (see Candle, Jablochkoff). As no crater is<br>
formed the light is disseminated equally both up and down. For this<br>
reason to get full downward illumination a reflector is recommended.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Alternating Current System.</span><br>
A system of electric distribution employing the alternating current. For<br>
transmission in the open air or in conduits a high potential circuit is<br>
used, from 1,000 to 10,000 volts being maintained at the central<br>
station. Two leads unconnected at the end lead from the station. Where<br>
current is desired a converter or transformer (see Converter) is placed,<br>
whose primary is connected to the two leads bridging the interval<br>
between them. From the secondary the house leads are taken with an<br>
initial potential in some cases of 50 volts. The converters are thus all<br>
placed in parallel. By law or insurance rules the converters are<br>
generally kept outside of buildings. Where no secondary current is taken<br>
from the converters very little primary current passes them on account<br>
of their counter-electromotive force. As more secondary current is taken<br>
the primary increases and this accommodation of one to the other is one<br>
of the interesting and valuable features. Street lamps are sometimes<br>
connected in series. Each lamp in such case is in parallel with a small<br>
coil with iron core. While the lamp is intact little current passes<br>
through the coil. If the lamp is broken, then the converter impedes the<br>
current by its spurious resistance, q. v., just enough to represent and<br>
replace the resistance of the extinguished and broken lamp filament.<br>
(See Meter, Alternating Current; Motor, Alternating Current.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Alternation.</span><br>
The change in direction of a current. The number of such changes is<br>
expressed as number of alternations; thus a current may have a frequency<br>
of 500 or 20,000 alternations per second.<br>
<br>
[Transcriber's note: One alternation per second is now called one
hertz.]<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Alternation, Complete. </span><br>
A double alternation; a change from one direction<br>
to the other and back again to the original phase. A symbol derived from<br>
its graphic representation by a sine curve is used to indicate it. The<br>
symbol is&nbsp; ~<br>
<br>
<br>
24&nbsp;&nbsp; STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Alternative Path.</span> <br>
A second path for a current appearing as a disruptive<br>
discharge. Where two paths are offered the discharge, as it is of<br>
alternating or oscillatory type, selects the path of least<br>
self-induction. Thus a thick bar of copper, with no air gap, may be<br>
abandoned by the current in favor of a small iron wire with an air gap,<br>
but which has less self-induction.<br>
<br>
The lightning arresters, q. v., for the protection of telegraph offices<br>
are sometimes based on these principles. A path of very high resistance<br>
but of small self-induction is offered between the line and the earth.<br>
This the lightning discharge selects in preference to the instruments<br>
with their iron cores, as the latter are of very high self-induction.<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Alternator. </span><br>
A dynamo electric generator supplying an alternating current. (See<br>
Dynamo, Alternating Current.)<br>
<br>
Synonym--Alternating current generator or dynamo.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Alternator, Constant Current.</span><br>
An alternating current dynamo supplying a current of unvarying virtual<br>
amperage. Alternators of this type are constructed with an armature of<br>
high self-induction. Sometimes fine winding contained in deep peripheral<br>
notches in the core-discs is employed to magnify the self-induction.<br>
Such generators are employed for series lighting, especially<br>
arc-lighting.<br>

25&nbsp; STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Amalgam.</span><br>
(a) A combination or alloy in which one of the constituents is mercury.<br>
Usually the term is applied to an alloy of a single metal with mercury.<br>
Some metals readily form amalgams; such metals are: Gold, zinc, silver,<br>
lead and others; some, such as platinum and iron, form amalgams only<br>
under exceptional circumstances.<br>
<br>
(b) The word is also applied to compositions for application to the<br>
cushions of frictional electric machine in which cases it is often a<br>
misnomer. True amalgams used for this purpose are made as follows:<br>
<br>
(a) Tin, 1 part;&nbsp; Zinc, 1 part;&nbsp; Mercury, 2 parts (Kienmayer).<br>
(b) Tin, 2 parts; Zinc, 3 parts.<br>
(c) Tin, 3 parts; Zinc, 5 parts; Mercury, 4 parts.<br>
(d) Zinc, 1 part: Mercury, 4 parts; Mercury, 9 parts.&nbsp; [sic]<br>
<br>
The tin, if such is used, (formula a, b and c) is first melted, the zinc<br>
is added in successive portions. The mercury, which must be heated, is<br>
slowly poured into the melted alloy after removal of the latter from the<br>
fire, and the mixture, while making, is constantly stirred. It is kept<br>
stirred or rubbed in a mortar until cold. Sometimes it is poured into<br>
water and kept in constant agitation until cold. It is thus obtained in<br>
a granular condition, and is pounded in a mortar until reduced to<br>
powder. It must be dried and kept in tightly stopped bottles and is<br>
applied to the cushions after they have been greased. It is to be<br>
noticed that it is said that alloy (d) requires no pulverization beyond<br>
constant rubbing in a mortar as it cools. Sometimes the amalgam is<br>
shaken about in a wooden tray with chalk while cooling. The action of<br>
amalgams is not very clearly understood. Some claim that there is a<br>
chemical action, others that they simply act as conductors, others that<br>
they are more highly negative to the glass than the leather of the<br>
cushions.<br>
<br>
Graphite or sulphide of tin (mosaic gold) are sometimes used to coat the<br>
cushions; it is these that are sometimes incorrectly called amalgams.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Amalgamation.</span><br>
The application of mercury to a metal with which it forms an amalgam, or<br>
with which it amalgamates. Battery zincs are amalgamated in two ways. In<br>
the immersion method, the plate is dipped into an acid solution of<br>
mercuric chloride or nitrate. The latter is best. In the direct<br>
application method the plate is first wet all over with dilute acid and<br>
a little mercury is dropped upon it and is rubbed over the surface with<br>
a rag or, what is better, with a piece of galvanized iron. A very little<br>
mercury answers the purpose. The whole surface of the plate should be<br>
left as bright as silver. (See Action, Local.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Amber.</span><br>
Amber is a fossil resin, supposed to be a product of the extinct Pinites<br>
Succinifer and other coniferous trees. Most of it is gathered on the<br>
shores of the Baltic between Koenigsberg and Memel. It is also found in<br>
small pieces at Gay Head, Mass., and in New Jersey green sand. It is<br>
found among the prehistoric remains of the Swiss Lake dwellers. When<br>
rubbed with a cloth it becomes excited with negative electricity. The<br>
Greek word for it is electron, which gave the name electricity to the<br>
modern science. Thales of Miletus, 600 B. C., and Theophrastus, about<br>
300 B. C., both mention its electric properties or power of attracting<br>
small objects when rubbed.<br>
<br>
<br>
26&nbsp;&nbsp; STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Ammeter.</span> <br>
The commercial name for an ampere-meter, an instrument designed<br>
to show by direct reading the number of amperes of current which are<br>
passing through a circuit.<br>
<br>
A great variety of ammeters have been invented, based on different<br>
principles. The definitions following this one give some idea of the<br>
lines of construction followed.<br>
<br>
Synonym--Ampere meter.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Ammeter, Ayrton's.</span><br>
A direct reading instrument for measuring current intensity.<br>
<br>
A solenoid receives the current. In the axis of the solenoid an iron<br>
tube is suspended by a long spiral spring that passes down within it,<br>
and the upper end of which spring is fastened to the glass top of the<br>
instrument. The tube is provided with proper guides so as to maintain a<br>
vertical position, and is free to rotate. Its upper end carries an<br>
index.<br>
<br>
The whole operates as a magnifying device. A slight longitudinal<br>
displacement of the tube causes it to rotate through a considerable<br>
angle by the action of the spring. By properly proportioning the parts,<br>
the angle of displacement of the index is directly proportional to the<br>
current between 15&ordm; and 270&ordm; angular displacement.<br>
<br>
The same instrument is wound for use as a volt-meter.<br>
<br>
Its principal fault is its restricted range.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Ammeter, Commutator.</span><br>
A commutator ammeter is one whose windings consist of separate strands,<br>
each of any desired number of turns, and provided with a commutating<br>
attachment for throwing them into series or into parallel as desired.<br>
The essential condition is that all the wires shall be of equal<br>
resistance and of equal number of turns. Such an instrument can be used<br>
for heavy or light currents. Two sets of graduations are marked on its<br>
scale if it is a calibrated instrument. (See Calibration.) Commutator<br>
volt-meters are constructed on the same principle.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Ammeter, Cunynghame's.</span><br>
A modification of the Siemens' electro-dynamometer. (See<br>
Electro-dynamometer, Siemens'.) An electro-magnet with very massive core<br>
is excited by the current. As the core is of small reluctance the<br>
strength of the magnet is nearly proportional to the current strength.<br>
Between the poles of the magnet a soft iron armature or induced magnet<br>
is pivoted. It carries a pointer so adjusted that when the axis of the<br>
soft iron magnet is at an angle of about 30&ordm; with the line joining
the<br>
poles of the electro-magnet the pointer will indicate zero.<br>
<br>
The soft iron armature is so massive that the magnetism induced in it is<br>
proportional to the strength of the electro-magnet. Hence the couple<br>
exerted by the electro-magnet on the pivoted armature will be<br>
proportional to the square of the current.<br>
<br>
The armature is retained in place by a spiral spring lying in line with<br>
its axis of rotation. The instrument is operated as a zero reading<br>
instrument. The current is passed through it. The needle is deflected;<br>
it is brought back to zero by turning a milled head which twists the<br>
spring. The current will be proportional to the square root of the angle<br>
of displacement of the milled head. A scale with index is provided,<br>
giving directly the square roots of the angle over which the pointer is<br>
moved.<br>
<br>
The same instrument is wound for use as a volt-meter.<br>

<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Ammeter, Eccentric Iron Disc.</span><br>
This ammeter comprises a cylindrical electro-magnet excited by the<br>
current to be measured. A disc of iron free to rotate is suspended on<br>
pivots below it. A piece is cut off the disc at one part of its<br>
periphery so as to give more metal to one side than to the other. In its<br>
zero position this portion of the disc swings towards the magnet. As the<br>
latter is more and more excited the other or more projecting portion of<br>
the disc turns towards it, being attracted like an armature, and moves<br>
against the force of gravity, the disc rotating. An index attached to<br>
the disc swings over the face of a graduated scale. The disc is so<br>
counterpoised that in its natural position the index points to zero.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Ammeter, Electro-magnetic.</span><br>
An ammeter depending for its working upon the action of an<br>
electro-magnet, which is excited by the current to be measured.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Ammeter, Gravity.</span><br>
An ammeter whose hand or index is drawn into the zero position by<br>
gravity, and whose displacement therefrom is produced by the action of<br>
the current to be measured.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Ammeter, Magnetic Vane.</span><br>
A fixed plate of soft iron is placed within a coil. Facing it is a<br>
second disc free to move or swing on an axis. When the field is excited<br>
the two repel each other because like polarity is induced in each, and<br>
the motion of the movable disc indicates the strength of the current.<br>

(see Ammeter, Ayrton's) and magnify the apparent range of motion.<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">

An ammeter in which the attraction, when a current is passing through<br>
it, exerted by a hollow coil of wire upon an iron bar or tube in line<br>
with its axis, is utilized to indicate the strength of current. The bar<br>
is drawn into the coil to different extents proportional to the<br>
attraction. As an example see Ammeter, Ayrton's, and cut of Gravity<br>
Ammeter.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Ammeter, Steel Yard.</span><br>
A solenoid ammeter in which the solenoid core is suspended vertically<br>
from the short end of a steel yard fitted with a sliding weight. The<br>
current passes through the solenoid coil and attracts or draws downwards<br>
the coil. A sliding weight is moved in and out on the long steel-yard<br>
arm which is graduated for amperes. In use the weight is slid out until<br>
the arm is in equipose; the divisions give the amperes.<br>

An apparatus for use on ships for hoisting ammunition to the guns by an<br>
electric elevator. The characteristic feature of it is that a constant<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Ampere.</span><br>
The practical unit of electric current strength. It is the measure of<br>
the current produced by an electro-motive force of one volt through a<br>
resistance of one ohm. In electric quantity it is the rate of one<br>
coulomb per second. It is one-tenth the absolute C. G. S. unit of<br>
current strength. Its best analogy is derived from water. Assuming the<br>
electric current to be represented by a current of water, the pressure,<br>
head, or descent producing such current would be the electro-motive<br>
force. The current might be measured in gallons (or other unit) passed<br>
per second. In the analogy these gallons would be coulombs. But it might<br>
be measured by reference to a standard stream, as for instance, the<br>
stream which would pass through a hole an inch square under a given<br>
head, say six inches of water. This unit is the miner's inch, and is the<br>
exact analogy of the ampere. A current of water may flow at the rate of<br>
so many miner's inches, just as a current of electricity may flow at the<br>
rate of so many amperes. In neither case it will be noted is there any<br>
reference to time. "An ampere per second" is a redundant expression, and<br>
means no more than "an ampere"; an "ampere-second," on the other hand,<br>
is a coulomb. The number of coulombs passed per second gives the amperes<br>
of current.<br>
<br>
For value of ampere, see Coulomb.<br>

[Transcriber's note: The SI definition of an ampere: A current in two<br>
straight parallel conductors of infinite length and negligible<br>
cross-section, 1 metre apart in vacuum, would produce a force equal to<br>
2E-7 newton per metre of length.]<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Ampere, Arc.</span><br>
A conductor bent into the arc of a circle, and employed in measuring the<br>
electric current by the electric balance.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Ampere-currents.</span><br>
The currents assumed to be the cause of magnetism. (See Magnetism,<br>

<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Ampere-feet.</span><br>
The product of amperes of current by the length, in feet, of a conductor<br>
passing such current. It may be in empiric calculations of dynamo or<br>
motor construction, but is little used. One ampere-foot is a current of<br>
one ampere passing through one foot length of a conductor, or one-tenth<br>
ampere through ten feet, and so on.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Ampere-hour.</span><br>
The quantity of electricity passed by a current of one ampere in one<br>
hour. It is used by electric power and lighting companies as the unit of<br>
energy supplied by them, because they maintain a constant potential<br>
difference in their leads, so that only the amperes and hours need<br>
measuring or recording to give the energy, viz. : volt-ampere-hours.<br>
The same unit is applied to batteries to indicate their potential<br>
energy, because they also are assumed to be of constant voltage or<br>
electro-motive force.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Ampere-meters.</span><br>
The product of amperes of current by the length, in meters, of a<br>
conductor carrying such current. One ampere-meter is a current of one<br>
ampere passing through one meter of a conductor.<br>
<br>
The term must not be confused with the identically spelled Ampere-meter,<br>
a synonym for Ammeter.<br>
<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Amperes, Lost.</span><br>
In a shunt or compound-wound dynamo, part of the total amperes of<br>
current produced in the armature coils go through the shunt, and hence,<br>
do not appear in the outer circuit. S. P. Thompson has proposed the term<br>
"lost amperes" for this portion of the current.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Ampere's Memoria Technica.</span><br>
An expression of the effect of a current on a magnetic needle. If we<br>
imagine the observer in the line of the current and facing the magnetic<br>
needle, the current entering by his feet and leaving by his head, the<br>
north pole is deflected to his left.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Ampere-turns.</span><br>
The amperes of current supplied to a magnet coil multiplied by the<br>
number of turns the current makes in the coil. If the coil is wound two<br>
or three in parallel, the virtual turns by which the amperes are<br>
multiplied are one-half or one-third the actual turns of wire.<br>
<br>

The ampere-turns in the secondary coil of an induction coil or<br>
transformer.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Amplitude of Waves.</span><br>
Waves are distinguished by length and amplitude. The latter, in the case<br>
of transverse waves, such as those of water and of the ether, correspond<br>
with and measure the height from lowest to highest point, or from valley<br>
to summit of the waves in question. In the case of longitudinal waves,<br>
such as those of the air, due to sounding bodies, the ratio of degree of<br>
rarefaction to degree of condensation existing in the system is the<br>
amplitude. The latter can be graphically represented by a sinuous line,<br>
such as would represent the section of a transverse wave. Ether waves<br>
are produced by heated bodies and by electro-magnetic impulses, as in<br>
the discharge of the Leyden jar.<br>
<br>
The amplitude of a wave, other things being equal, is the measure of its<br>
intensity. Thus, the louder a sound the greater is the amplitude of the<br>
system of waves to which it is due. The same applies to ether waves,<br>
whether they are perceived in the electro-magnetic, light, or<br>
heat-giving modification. As the amplitude of ether waves cannot be<br>
accurately known, amplitude is a relative term and is not stated<br>
generally in any absolute unit.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Analogous Pole.</span><br>
One of the elements of a pyro-electric crystalline substance, such as<br>
tourmaline. When heated, such bodies acquire electrical properties. If<br>
of such crystalline form that they are differently modified at the ends<br>
of their crystalline axis, by hemihedral modifications, the ends may be<br>
differently affected. One end may show positive electricity when the<br>
temperature is rising, and negative when falling. Such end is then<br>
called the analogous pole. The opposite end presents, in such cases, the<br>
opposite phenomena; becoming negative when the temperature is rising,<br>
and becoming positive when it is falling; such end is called the<br>
antilogous pole.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Analysis.</span><br>
The determination of the elements of a case. It may be chemical, and<br>
consist in finding what a substance consists of; it may be mathematical,<br>
and consist in determining the unknown quantities in a problem; or it<br>
may belong to other branches of science. The term has a very extended<br>
application. Where the constituents are only determined in kind it is<br>
called qualitative analysis; where their quantity or percentage is<br>
ascertained it is called quantitative analysis.<br>
<br>
<br>

Analysis.)<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Analyzer, Electric.</span><br>
An apparatus used in investigations on electric ether waves. It consists<br>
of a series of parallel metallic wires. When the electric waves have<br>
been polarized, the analyzer will only permit them to go through it<br>
intact, when the plane of vibration of the waves is parallel to its<br>
wires.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Anelectrics.</span><br>
(a) Bodies which do not become electrified by friction; a term<br>
introduced by Gilbert, now little used, as all bodies develop<br>
electricity under proper conditions by contact action; the reverse of<br>
idioelectrtics.<br>
<br>
(b) Also a conductor of electricity, the reverse of a dielectric, q. v.<br>
(See Conductor.)<br>
<br>
It will be seen that Gilbert's anelectrics were, after all, the same as<br>
the modern anelectrics, i.e., conductors.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Anelectrotonus.</span><br>
A term used in medical electricity or electro-therapeutics to indicate<br>
the deceased functional activity induced in a nerve by the proximity of<br>
the anode of an active electric circuit completed through the nerve. The<br>
converse of Kathelectrotonus.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Angle of Declination.</span><br>
The angle of error of the magnetic needle or compass, measuring the<br>
extent of its deviation from the meridian in any locality. It is the<br>
angle between the plane of the magnetic axis of a magnetic needle free<br>
to take its natural position, and the geographical meridian, the needle<br>
being counterpoised if necessary, so as to hold an absolutely horizontal<br>
position. The deviation is expressed as being east or west, referring<br>
always to the north pole. (See Magnetic Elements.)<br>

<br>
[Transcriber's note:&nbsp; See Agonic Line.]<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Angle of the Polar Span.</span><br>
In a dynamo or motor the angle subtended by the portion of a pole piece<br>
facing the armature, such angle being referred to the centre of the<br>
cross-section of the armature as its centre.<br>
<br>
<br>
33&nbsp;&nbsp; STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Angular Velocity.</span><br>
The velocity of a body moving in a circular path, measured with<br>
reference to the angle it passes over in one second multiplied by the<br>
radius and divided by the time. A unit angle is taken (57&deg;.29578 =<br>
57&deg; 17' 44".8 nearly) such that it is subtended by a portion of the<br>
circumference equal in length to the radius. Hence, the circumference,<br>
which is 360&deg;, is equal to 2*PI*unit angle, PI being equal to
3.1416--.<br>
"Unit angular velocity" is such as would in a circle of radius = 1<br>
represent a path = 1, traversed in unit time = 1 second. If the radius<br>
is r and the angle passed over is theta, the distance is proportional to<br>
r*theta; if this distance is traversed in t seconds the angular velocity<br>
is theta / t. The angular velocity, if it is multiplied by r, theta<br>
expressing a distance, will give the linear velocity. The dimensions of<br>
angular velocity are an angle (= arc / radius) / a Time = (L/L)/T =<br>
(T^-1).<br>
<br>
The velocity expressed by the rate of an arc of a circle of unit radius,<br>
which arc subtends an angle of 57&deg; 17' 44".8, such arc being
traversed<br>
in unit time, is unit angular velocity.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Animal Electricity.</span><br>
Electricity, notably of high tension, generated in the animal system, in<br>
the Torpedo, Gymnotus and Silurus. The shocks given by these fish are<br>
sometimes very severe. The gymnotus, or electric eel, was elaborately<br>
investigated by Faraday. It has the power of voluntarily effecting this<br>
discharge. There is undoubtedly some electricity in all animals. The<br>
contact of the spinal column of a recently killed frog with the lumbar<br>
muscles produces contraction, showing electric excitement. Currents can<br>
be obtained from nerve and muscle, or from muscle sides and muscle cut<br>
transversely, in each case one thing representing positive and the other<br>
negative elements of a couple.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Angle of Inclination or Dip.</span><br>
The angle which the magnetic axis of a magnet, which magnet is free to<br>
move in the vertical plane of the magnetic meridian, makes with a<br>
horizontal line intersecting such axis. To observe it a special<br>
instrument, the dipping compass, inclination compass, dipping needle, or<br>
dipping circle, as it is called, is used. (See Elements, Magnetic,<br>
--Dipping Needle,--Compass, Inclination.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Angle of Lag.</span><br>
The angle expressing the displacement of the magnetic axis of the<br>
armature core of a dynamo in the direction of its rotation. (See Lag.)<br>
Lag is due to the motion of the armature core.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Angle of Lead.</span><br>
The angle expressing the displacement in the direction of rotation of<br>
the armature of a dynamo which has to be given the brushes to compensate<br>
for the lag. (See Lag.) This is positive lead. In a motor the brushes<br>
are set the other way, giving a negative angle of lead or angle of<br>
negative lead.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Anion.</span><br>
The electro-negative element or radical of a molecule, such as oxygen,<br>
chlorine or the radical sulphion. (See Ions.) It is the portion which<br>
goes to the anode, q.v., in electrolytic decomposition.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Anisotropic. (adj.)</span><br>
Unequal in physical properties, as in conduction and specific inductive<br>
capacity, along various axes or directions. An anisotropic conductor is<br>
one whose conductivity varies according to the direction of the current,<br>
each axis of crystallization in a crystalline body marking a direction<br>
of different conductivity. An anisotropic medium is one varying in like<br>
manner with regard to its specific inductive capacity. In magnetism an<br>
anisotropic substance is one having different susceptibilities to<br>
magnetism in different directions. The term is applicable to other than<br>
electric or magnetic subjects.<br>
<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Annealing, Electric.</span><br>
Annealing by the heat produced by the passage of the electric current<br>
through the body to be annealed. The object is clamped or otherwise<br>
brought into a circuit, and a current strong enough to heat it to<br>
redness, or to the desired temperature is passed through it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Annunciator.</span><br>
An apparatus for announcing a call from any place to another, as from a<br>
living-room to an office in a hotel, or for announcing the entering of<br>
any given room or window in a building protected by a burglar alarm.<br>
<br>
A usual system comprises for each annunciator an electro-magnet. Its<br>
armature is normally held away from its poles by a spring, and when in<br>
that position a latch connected to the armature holds a little shutter.<br>
When by a push-button or other device a current is sent through a<br>
circuit which includes the electro-magnet the armature is attracted,<br>
this releases the latch and the shutter drops. In dropping it displays a<br>
number, letter or inscription which indicates the locality of the<br>
push-button or other circuit-closing device. Often annunciators are<br>
connected in circuit with a bell.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Anode.</span><br>
The positive terminal in a broken metallic or true conducting circuit;<br>
the terminal connected to the carbon plate of a galvanic battery or to<br>
its equivalent in case of any other generator. In general practice it is<br>
restricted to the positive terminal in a decomposition or electrolytic<br>
cell, such as the nickel anode in a nickel-plating bath or the anode of<br>
platinum in a gas voltameter. It is the terminal out of or from which<br>
the current is supposed to flow through the decomposition cell. In<br>
electro-therapeutics the term is used simply to indicate the positive<br>
terminal. In an electrolytic cell the electro-negative substance or<br>
anion goes to the anode. Hence, it is the one dissolved, if either are<br>
attacked. The nickel, copper or silver anodes of the electroplater<br>
dissolve in use and keep up the strength of the bath. The platinum anode<br>
in a gas voltameter is unattacked because the anion cannot act upon it<br>
chemically.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Anodic Closure Contraction.</span><br>
A physiological change in a living subject produced by the closing of<br>

the anode applied to the surface of the body when the circuit is closed,<br>
the kathode being applied elsewhere; it is due, presumably, to direct<br>
action on the motor nerve. It is a term in electro-therapeutics. It is<br>
the converse of anodic opening contraction, q. v. An abbreviation A. C.<br>
C. is often used to designate it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Anodic Duration Contraction.</span><br>
A term in electro-therapeutics. On the opening or closing of an electric<br>
circuit, the anode of which is placed over a muscle, a contraction is<br>
observed (see Anodic Closure Contraction--Anodic Opening Contraction).<br>
The above term is used to designate the duration of such contraction. An<br>

A conductor constructed to avoid induction effects in the conducting<br>
element. Many kinds have been made. A tubular metal shield or envelope<br>
which may be grounded will protect an enclosed conductor to some extent.<br>
Or the conductor may be a double wire twisted around itself, one branch<br>
being used for the regular and the other for the return circuit, thus<br>
constituting a closed metallic circuit. The inductive effects are due to<br>
interrupted or varying currents in neighboring wires and circuits. Many<br>
anti-induction conductors have been invented and patented.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Anvil.</span><br>
An intermittent contact, or "make and break" of the current is sometimes<br>
produced by directly pressing a key down upon a metallic surface, the<br>
two being terminals of the circuit. The surface or stud on which such<br>
pressure is produced is called the anvil. The ordinary telegraph key,<br>
which makes a contact by the pressure of the operator's fingers does it<br>
by making a contact between a contact piece upon the front end of the<br>
key and the anvil. In the induction coil the anvil is also found. Thus<br>
in the cut representing the end of an induction coil and its circuit<br>
breaker in which O and O' and P and P' represent the secondary circuit<br>
terminal connections A is the core of soft iron wires, h is the anvil;<br>
the hammer when resting upon it so as to be in contact closes the<br>
circuit. When the current coming from the primary to the post i, passes<br>
through the hammer and anvil h, and emerges by m, it magnetizes the<br>
core; this attracts the hammer, which is made of or is armed with a mass<br>
of iron. This breaks the circuit. The hammer falls at once on the anvil,<br>
again making the circuit, and the action is repeated with great<br>
rapidity. Hammer and anvil or key and anvil connections should be made<br>
of platinum.<br>

The voltaic arc produced between terminals or electrodes of metal. The<br>
characteristics of such arc as contrasted with the more usual arc<br>
between carbon electrodes are its greater length for the same<br>
expenditure of energy, its flaming character and characteristic colors<br>
due to the metals employed. It is sometimes, for the latter reason, used<br>
in spectroscopic investigations.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Arc, Voltaic.</span><br>
The voltaic arc is the arc between two carbon electrodes slightly<br>
separated, which is produced by a current of sufficient strength and<br>
involving sufficient potential difference. The pencils of carbon are<br>
made terminals in a circuit. They are first placed in contact and after<br>
the current is established they are separated a little. The current now<br>
seems to jump across the interval in what sometimes appears an arch of<br>
light. At the same time the carbon ends become incandescent. As regards<br>
the distance of separation with a strong current and high electro-motive<br>
force, the arc may be several inches long.<br>
<br>
The voltaic arc is the source of the most intense heat and brightest<br>
light producible by man. The light is due principally to the<br>
incandescence of the ends of the carbon pencils. These are differently<br>
affected. The positive carbon wears away and becomes roughly cupped or<br>
hollowed; the negative also wears away, but in some cases seems to have<br>
additions made to it by carbon from the positive pole. All this is best<br>
seen when the rods are slender compared to the length of the arc.<br>
<br>
It is undoubtedly the transferred carbon dust which has much to do with<br>
its formation. The conductivity of the intervening air is due partly,<br>
perhaps, to this, but undoubtedly in great measure to the intense<br>
heating to which it is subject. But the coefficient of resistance of the<br>
intervening air is so much higher than that of any other part of the<br>
circuit that an intense localization of resistance occurs with<br>
corresponding localization of heating effect. This is the cause of the<br>
intense light. Thus if the carbons are but 1/32 of an inch apart as in a<br>
commercial lamp the resistance may be 1.5 ohms. The poor thermal<br>
conductivity of the carbon favors the concentration of heat also. The<br>
apparent resistance is too great to be accounted for by the ohmic<br>
resistance of the interposed air. A kind of thermoelectric effect is<br>
produced. The positive carbon has a temperature of about 4,000&deg; C.<br>
(7,232&deg; F.), the negative from 3,000&deg; C. (5,432&deg; F.) to
3,500&deg; C.<br>
(6,322&deg; F.). This difference of temperature produces a<br>
counter-electro-motive force which acts to virtually increase the<br>
resistance of the arc. The carbon ends of an arc can be projected with<br>
the lantern. Globules are seen upon them due to melted silica from the<br>
arc of the carbon.<br>

An instrument for determining the specific gravity of a fluid. It<br>
consists of an elongated body ballasted so as to float vertically and<br>
provided with a mark or a scale. It floats deeper in a light than in a<br>
heavy liquid. If it carries but one mark weights are added until that<br>
mark is reached, when the weights required give the specific gravity. Or<br>
the scale may give the reading directly based upon the depth to which it<br>
sinks. Areometers are often made of glass, ballasted with shot or<br>
mercury enclosed in their bottom bulb as shown. They are used in<br>
regulating battery solutions, and in watching the charging and<br>
discharging of storage batteries.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Armature.</span><br>
(a.) A mass or piece of iron or steel, or a collection of pieces of iron<br>
designed to be acted on by a magnet. While nickel or cobalt might be<br>
used, they rarely or never are except in experimental apparatus. The<br>
armature of a permanent horse shoe magnet is simply a little bar of soft<br>
iron. When the magnet is not in use it is kept in contact with the poles<br>
with the idea of retaining its magnetism. It is then said to be used as<br>
a keeper. A bar magnet does not generally have an armature. The armature<br>
is also used to exhibit the attraction of the magnet.<br>
<br>
Sometimes an armature is made of steel and is permanently magnetized.<br>
Such an armature, termed a polarized armature, is repelled when its like<br>
poles are opposed to like poles of the magnet and otherwise is attracted<br>
with force due to the sums of the magnetism. If the magnet is<br>
sufficiently powerful depolarization of the armature may ensue when like<br>
poles are opposed to like poles. Polarized armatures are used in various<br>
appliances, magneto generators, telegraphic instruments and others.<br>
<br>
(b) In a dynamo or Motor the mass of laminated iron or of wire which<br>
carries the coils of insulated wires which are caused to rotate in the<br>
field of force of the field magnets in order to establish and maintain<br>
potential difference with its accompanying current, or which rotates<br>
under the effects of a current in a motor. (See Dynamo Electric<br>
Generator.)<br>
<br>
The work of the armature core is twofold. It acts as a portion of the<br>
magnetic circuit, conducting the lines of force, and by virtue of its<br>
high permeability or multiplying power concentrating a number of the<br>
lines of force through its own substance. To enable it to act with<br>
efficiency in this direction it should be made of iron of the highest<br>
permeability, and should approach as closely as possible to the armature<br>
cores consistent with leaving space for the wire winding. It next acts<br>
as a support for the wires which are to be swept through the field of<br>
force. Thus it acts both to establish a strong field and then acts as a<br>
carrier for the wires which are to be cut by the wires in question. In<br>
connection with this subject the different definitions under Armature,<br>
Dynamo, Commutator, Induction and similar topics may be consulted.<br>

An early form of motor. The field is produced by a permanent magnet.<br>
Above its poles is a soft iron armature wound with a coil of insulated<br>

the coil. The whole is so arranged that the polarity of the armature, as<br>
induced by the coil, through which a current is passed, is reversed as<br>
its ends sweep by the poles of the magnet. Then it is repelled from the<br>
poles and swings through 180&deg; to have its polarity reversed and to
go<br>
through the next 180&deg;, and so on. Thus it rotates at a very high

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Astatic Needle. </span><br>
A combination of two magnetic needles so adjusted as to<br>
have as slight directive tendency as possible. Such a pair of needles<br>
when poised or suspended will hardly tend to turn more to one point of<br>
the compass than another. The combination is generally made up of two<br>
needles arranged one above the other, with their poles in opposite<br>
directions. This combination is usually called Nobili's pair. If of<br>
equal strength and with parallel magnetic axes of equal length they<br>
would be astatic. In practice this is very rarely the case. A resultant<br>
axis is generally to be found which may even be at right angles to the<br>
long axis of the magnets, causing them to point east and west. Such a<br>
compound needle requires very little force to turn it one way or the<br>
other. If one of the needles is placed within a coil of insulated wire a<br>
feeble current will act almost as strongly to deflect the system as if<br>
the other was absent, and the deflection will only be resisted by the<br>
slight directive tendency of the pair of needles. This is the basis of<br>
construction of the astatic galvanometer. Sometimes coils wound in<br>
opposite directions and connected in series, or one following the other,<br>
surround both needles, thus producing a still greater effect of<br>
deflection.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Atmospheric Electricity.</span><br>
The electricity of the atmosphere, rarely absent, but often changing in<br>
amount and sign. Benjamin Franklin, in a memoir published in 1749,<br>
indicated the method of drawing electricity from the clouds by pointed<br>
conductors. In June, 1752, he flew a kite and by its moistened cord drew<br>
an electric spark from the clouds, confirming his hypothesis that<br>
lightning was identical with the disruptive discharge of electricity. To<br>
observe electricity in fine weather a gold-leaf or other electroscope<br>
may be connected to the end of a long pointed insulated conductor. The<br>
electricity during thunderstorms can be shown by a similar arrangement,<br>
or burning alcohol or tinder gives an ascending current of warm air that<br>
acts as a conductor. Quite elaborate apparatus for observing and<br>
recording it have been devised. Atmospheric electricity is usually<br>
positive, but occasionally negative. When the sky is cloudless it is<br>
always positive, increasing with the elevation and isolation of the<br>
place. In houses, streets, and under trees no positive electricity can<br>
be found. In the Isle of Arran, Scotland, a rise of 24 to 48 volts per<br>
foot of increase in elevation was found by Sir William Thomson. At<br>
sunrise the electrification of the air is feeble, it increases towards<br>
noon and decreases again to reach a second maximum a few hours after<br>
sunset. It increases with the barometric pressure generally. In cloudy<br>
weather it is sometimes negative and the sign often changes several<br>
times in the same day. In a thunderstorm the changes in sign and<br>
potential are very rapid. The cause of atmospheric electricity is far<br>
from clear. Tait attributes it to a contact effect between air and water<br>
vapor, Solmeke to friction of water vesicles against ice particles in<br>
the upper atmosphere, he first showing that the two may coexist. The<br>
cause of the enormous increase of potential producing lightning is<br>
attributed to the decreased capacity due to the change of water from<br>
cloud vesicles to drops, thus diminishing the electrostatic capacity of<br>
the water in question. (See Lightning.)<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Atom.</span><br>
The ultimate particle or division of an elementary substance; the<br>
smallest part that can exist in combination, and one which cannot exist<br>
alone. An elementary substance is composed of molecules just as truly as<br>
a compound one, but the atoms in the molecule of an elementary substance<br>
are all precisely alike. Hence atoms are the units of chemistry, they<br>
have to do with combinations, but the physical unit, the smallest<br>
particle of matter that can have an independent existence, is the<br>
molecule. The two are often confounded, especially by writers of a few<br>
years ago, so that by "atom" the molecule is often meant. There is<br>
nothing to be said of their size or mass. All such calculations refer to<br>
the molecule, q. v., often spoken of and called the atom.<br>
<br>
[Transcriber's note: Yet to be discovered: electron--1897 (5 years),<br>
proton--1920 (28 years), neutron--1932 (30 years), quark--1961 (69
years).]<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Atomic Attraction.</span><br>
The attraction of atoms for each other, in virtue of which they combine<br>
into molecules; chemical affinity, q. v., treats principally of this,<br>
although molecular attraction also plays a part in it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Atomic Heat.</span><br>
The product of the atomic weight of a substance by its specific heat.<br>
This product is approximately the same, 6.4; this approximation is so<br>
close that it is of use in determining the valency and atomic weights of<br>
substances. The atomic weight of a substance therefore represents the<br>
approximate number of gram-calories required to raise one gram-atom, q.<br>
v., of such substance through 1&deg; C. (1.8&deg; F.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Atomicity.</span><br>
The quantivalence or valency of the atoms; the number of combination<br>
bonds, or bonds of affinity, possessed by the atoms of any substance.<br>
Thus two atoms of hydrogen combine with one atom of oxygen, and three of<br>
oxygen with one of sulphur, forming saturated compounds. Therefore,<br>
taking hydrogen as of single atomicity or a monad, oxygen is of double<br>
atomicity or a dyad, and sulphur is of six-fold atomicity, or a hexad.<br>
The elements are thus classified into seven orders of atomicities, thus:<br>
<br>
&nbsp; <span style="font-family: monospace;">1, Monads or Univalent
elements,&nbsp;&nbsp; Hydrogen, etc.</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;2, Dyads or
Bivalent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oxygen, etc.</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;3, Triads or
Trivalent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nitrogen, etc.</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;4, Tetrads or
Quadrivalent&nbsp; "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Lead, etc.</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;5, Pentads or Quinquivalent
"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Phosphorous, etc.</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;6, Hexads or
Sexivalent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chromium, etc.</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;7, Heptads or
Septivalent&nbsp;&nbsp;
"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chromium, etc.</span><br>
<br>
The same element often possesses several atomicities. Barium is<br>
generally a dyad, sometimes a tetrad; nitrogen acts as a monad, dyad,<br>
triad, tetrad and pentad. The familiar electrolysis of water, giving two<br>
volumes of hydrogen to one of oxygen, is one of the illustrations of the<br>
theory indicating that two atoms of hydrogen are combined with one of<br>
oxygen.<br>

<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Atomic Weight.</span><br>
The number expressing the relative weight of the atom of any substance,<br>
that of hydrogen being generally taken as unity. This is the universal<br>
system, although any other element might be taken as the basis of the<br>
system. The whole theory of atomic weights is based on the<br>
indivisibility of the atom and on the theory of atomicity, q. v. (See<br>
Equivalents.)<br>
<br>
[Transcriber's note: The standard is now the isotope carbon-12 as<br>
exactly 12.]<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Attraction.</span><br>
The tendency to approach and adhere or cohere, shown by all forms of<br>
matter. It includes gravitation, cohesion, adhesion, chemical affinity<br>
and other forms, and is opposed by repulsion, and is sometimes overcome<br>
by it, although it may be assumed to be always present. See the<br>
different kinds of attractions under their titles: Atomic Attraction,<br>
Electro-magnetic Attraction and Repulsion, Electro Static Attraction and<br>
Repulsion, Electro-dynamic Attraction and Repulsion; Magnetic Attraction<br>
and Repulsion; Molar Attraction.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Audiometer.</span><br>
An apparatus for obtaining a balance of induction from two coils acting<br>
upon a third. The third is placed between the other two and is free to<br>
move towards either. A scale is provided to show the extent of its<br>
movement. A varying or interrupted current being passed through the two<br>
outer coils, the preponderating current will produce the most induction<br>
if the central coil is equidistant. It can always be moved to such a<br>
point that there will be no inductive effect, one counteracting the<br>
other. Thus its position measures the relative induction. A telephone is<br>
in circuit with the intermediate coil and is used to determine when its<br>
position is such that no current is induced in it. It is sometimes used<br>
as a direct test of hearing. (See Hughes' Induction Balance.)<br>

<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Aura, Electrical.</span><br>
The blast of air produced at highly electrified points.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Aurora.</span><br>
A luminous display seen in the northern heavens in the northern<br>
hemisphere, where it is the Aurora Borealis, and seen in the southern<br>
heavens in the southern hemisphere, where it is called Aurora Australis,<br>
or indifferently for either, the Aurora Polaris. It takes the form of<br>
pale luminous bands, rays and curtains varying in color. Near the poles<br>
they are very numerous. A French commission observed 150 auroras in 200<br>
days. Their height is variously estimated at from 90 to 460 miles; they<br>
are most frequent at the equinoxes and least so at the solstices. There<br>
is a secular variation also, they attain a maximum of occurrence every<br>
11 years together with sun spots, with a minimum 5 or 6 years after the<br>
maximum. There is also a period of 60 years, coincident with<br>
disturbances in the earth's magnetism. Various attempts have been made<br>
to account for them. They have a constant direction of arc with<br>
reference to the magnetic meridian (q. v.) and act upon the magnetic<br>
needle; in high latitudes they affect telegraph circuits violently.<br>
There is a strong probability that they represent electric currents or<br>
discharges. De la Rive considers them due to electric discharges between<br>
the earth and atmosphere, which electricities are separated by the<br>
action of the sun in equatorial regions. According to Balfour Stewart,<br>
auroras and earth currents.(q. v.) may be regarded as secondary currents<br>
due to small but rapid changes in the earth's magnetism. The subject is<br>
very obscure. Stewart treats the earth as representing the magnetic core<br>
of an induction coil, the lower air is the dielectric, and the upper<br>
rarefied and therefore conducting atmosphere is the secondary coil. This<br>
makes the aurora a phenomenon of induced currents. Then the sun may be<br>
regarded as the instigator of the primary changes in the earth's lines<br>
of force representing the primary of an induction coil.<br>
<br>
[Transcriber's note: Solar wind, streams of electrons and protons,<br>
interacting with the earth's magnetic field causes aurora. Neither<br>
electrons (1897) nor protons (1920) were known in 1892. The Soviet<br>
satellite Luna first measured the solar wind in 1959. Even today<br>
increased understanding of solar and auroral phenomenon continues.]<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Austral Pole.</span><br>
The north pole of the magnet is thus called sometimes in France; the<br>
austral pole of a magnet is the one which points towards the north polar<br>
regions As unlike magnetic poles attract each other, it is but rational<br>
to call the north-seeking pole of the magnet the south or Austral Pole.<br>
In the same nomenclature the south pole of a magnet, or the<br>
south-seeking pole, is called the Boreal Pole.<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Balance, Ampere.</span><br>
A class of electrical measuring instruments due to Sir William Thomson<br>
may be grouped under this head.<br>
<br>
The instrument is a true balance or scales such as used for weighing. It<br>
is supported by a torsional wire support in place of knife edges. At<br>
each end it carries a circle of wire through which the current to be<br>
tested is passed. The torsional wire support enables the current to be<br>
carried to these wire rings. Above and below each of these rings are two<br>
similar rings, also connected so as to receive the current. They are so<br>
connected that the current shall go through them in opposite senses.<br>
When a current passes, therefore, one of these rings repels and one<br>
attracts the balanced ring.<br>
<br>
The extent of this action measures the intensity of the current. A<br>
sliding weight moving along a graduated scale on the balance is used to<br>
bring the balance beam into equilibrium when the current is passing. The<br>
degree of displacement of this weight gives the strength of the current<br>
in amperes.<br>
<br>
These balances are made for different currents. Thus there is a<br>
centi-ampere balance, deka-ampere balance and others, as well as an<br>
ampere balance.<br>

<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Barometer.</span><br>
An apparatus for measuring the pressure exerted by the atmosphere. It<br>
consists, in the mercurial form, of a glass tube, over 31 inches long,<br>
closed at one end, filled with mercury and inverted, with its open end<br>
immersed in a cistern of mercury. The column falls to a height<br>
proportional to the pressure of the atmosphere from 30 to 31 inches at<br>
the sea level. The "standard barometer" is a height of the mercury or of<br>
the "barometric column" of 30 inches or 760 centimeters, measured from<br>
the surface of the mercury in the cistern.<br>
<br>
The column of mercury is termed the barometric column. Above it in the<br>

<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Battery, Column.</span><br>
The original Volta's pile. It consists of a series of compound circular<br>
plates, the upper or lower half, A, copper; the other, Z, of zinc.<br>
Between each pair of plates some flannel or cloth, u, u, is laid, which<br>
is saturated with dilute acid. As shown in the cut, the parts are laid<br>
up in two piles, connected at the top with a bar, c, c, and with vessels<br>
of acidulated water, b, b, as electrodes. The great point in setting it<br>
up is to be sure that no acid runs from one disc of flannel to the next<br>
over the outside of the plates, as this would create a short circuit.<br>
The plates are best compound, being made up of a zinc and a copper plate<br>
soldered together. They may, however, be separate, and merely laid one<br>
on the other. In such case great care must be taken to admit no acid<br>
between them.<br>
<br>
Volta's pile is no longer used, except occasionally. Trouv&eacute;'s
blotting<br>
paper battery (see Battery, Trouv&eacute;'s) is a relic of it, and the
same is<br>
to be said for Zamboni's dry pile.<br>
<br>
It rapidly polarizes, the flannel retains but little acid, so that it is<br>
soon spent, and it is very troublesome to set up. Great care must be<br>
taken to have the cloth discs thoroughly saturated, and wrung out to<br>
avoid short circuiting by squeezing out of the acid.<br>

immersed in cups of dilute acid, arranged as if they were plates of zinc<br>
and carbon, in an ordinary battery. Each plate is surrounded by a glass<br>
tube sealed at the top. The plates are filled with acid to the tops.<br>
Through the top the connection is made. A current from another battery<br>
is then passed through it, decomposing the water and surrounding the<br>
upper part of one set of plates with an atmosphere of oxygen and of the<br>
other with hydrogen. Considerable quantities of these gasses are also<br>
occluded by the plates. On now connecting the terminals of the battery,<br>
it gives a current in the reverse direction of that of the charging<br>
current.<br>

A battery of the Daniell type, in which the porous cup is suppressed and<br>
the separation of the fluids is secured by their difference in specific<br>
gravity. A great many forms have been devised, varying only in details.<br>
The copper plate, which is sometimes disc shaped, but in any case of<br>
inconsiderable height, rests at the bottom of the jar. Near the top the<br>
zinc plate, also flat or of slight depth, is supported. As exciting<br>
liquid a strong solution of copper sulphate lies at the bottom of the<br>
jar. This is overlaid by a solution of zinc sulphate, or sodium<br>
sulphate, which must be of considerably less specific gravity than that<br>
of the copper sulphate solution. In charging the jar one-tenth of a<br>
saturated solution of zinc sulphate mixed with water is sometimes used<br>
as the upper fluid. This may be first added so as to half fill the jar.<br>
The strong solution of copper sulphate may then be added with a syphon<br>
or syringe underneath the other so as to raise it up. From time to time<br>
copper sulphate in crystals are dropped into the jar. They sink to the<br>
bottom and maintain the copper sulphate solution in a state of<br>
saturation.<br>

<br>
If the battery is left on open circuit the liquids diffuse, and metallic<br>
copper precipitates upon the zincs. This impairs its efficiency and<br>
creates local action. As long as the battery is kept at work on closed<br>
circuit work but little deposition, comparatively speaking, occurs.<br>
<br>
From time to time, in any case, the zinc plates are removed and scraped,<br>
so as to remove the copper which inevitably forms on their surface. Care<br>
must be taken that the zinc sulphate solution, which is constantly<br>
increasing in strength, does not get so strong as to become of as high<br>
specific gravity as the copper sulphate solution. From time to time some<br>
of the upper solution is therefore removed with a syphon or syringe and<br>
replaced with water. An areometer is useful in running this battery.<br>

A two fluid galvanic battery. A porous cup has within it a riband of<br>
platinum, which is the negative plate; amalgamated zinc in the outer jar<br>
is the positive plate. Dilute sulphuric acid (10 per cent. solution) is<br>
placed in the outer jar, and strong nitric acid (40&deg; B.) as a<br>
depolarizer in the porous cups. Its E. M. F. is 1.96 volts.<br>
<br>
It is objectionable, as it gives off corrosive nitrous fumes. These are<br>
produced by the oxidation of the nascent hydrogen by the nitric acid, by<br>
the following reaction:<br>
<br>
3 H + H N O3 = 2 H2 O + N O. There are other reactions, one of which<br>
results in the formation of ammonia by the reduction of the nitric acid<br>
radical by the hydrogen. Ammonium can be detected in the spent liquids.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Battery, Secondary.</span><br>
A voltaic battery whose positive and negative electrodes are formed or<br>
deposited by a current from a separate source of electricity by<br>
electrolysis. On disconnection the battery is ready to yield a current,<br>
in the reverse direction of that of the charging current. The usual type<br>
has lead plates on one of which lead binoxide and on the other of which<br>
spongy lead is formed. The lead binoxide seems to be the negative<br>
element, and it also acts as the depolarizer. The spongy lead is the<br>
positive electrode. The solution is dilute sulphuric acid of specific<br>
gravity 1.17. The action consists first in the oxidation of the spongy<br>
lead. The hydrogen set free by the reaction, and which by electrolytic<br>
transfer goes to the other plate, reduces the lead binoxide to<br>
protoxide. The sulphuric acid then attacks the oxides and converts the<br>
oxides into sulphates.<br>
<br>
The charging process consists in sending a current in the reverse <br>
direction through the battery. If there are several cells they are <br>
arranged in series, so that each one receives the same intensity of <br>
current. An electrolytic decomposition takes place, the lead sulphate
on <br>
one plate is reduced to metallic lead, and that on the other plate is <br>
oxidized to lead binoxide. It is then ready for use.<br>

the plates are in sets, the positive and negative ones alternating, and<br>
each cell containing a number of plates.<br>
<br>
To secure a good quantity of active material, the plates are sometimes<br>
perforated, and the perforations are filled with oxide of lead. This<br>
gives a good depth of material for the charging current to act on, and<br>
avoids the necessity for a tedious "forming," q. v.<br>
<br>
The electro-motive force of such a battery per cell is 2 volts. Its<br>
resistance may only be one or two-hundredths of an ohm. An intense<br>
current of many amperes can be supplied by it, but to avoid injuring the<br>
cell a current far less than the maximum is taken from it.<br>
<br>
To charge it, a slightly greater electro-motive force, the excess being<br>
termed spurious voltage, is required.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Battery, Secondary, Plante's.</span><br>
Plante's secondary battery is one of the earlier forms of storage<br>
battery, but has had much success. Two lead plates, large in area and<br>
close together but not touching, are "formed," by exposure to an<br>
electrolyzing current of electricity in one direction, while they are<br>
immersed in dilute sulphuric acid. This converts the surface of one<br>
plate into binoxide. The cell is then allowed to discharge itself almost<br>
completely, when the charging current is again turned on. This process<br>
is repeated over and over again, until the surfaces of the plates are<br>
considerably attacked, one plate, however, being maintained in a state<br>
of oxidation. After a few days of this operation a period of rest is<br>
allowed between the reversals, which sets up a local action on the<br>
oxidized plate, between the metallic lead of the plate, and its coating<br>
of binoxide. This causes the lead to be attacked, under the influence of<br>
the local couple, and sulphate of lead is formed, which, ultimately, by<br>
the charging current is converted into peroxide. These operations<br>
produce an exceedingly good battery. The process described is termed<br>
forming.<br>
<br>
The plates separated by strips of insulating material are generally<br>
wound into a double spiral.<br>

A Daniell battery of peculiar shape. The copper, C, is at the bottom of<br>
the glass jar, A. The inner jar, K, has the form of a bell, and supports<br>
a mass of paper pulp, which is dampened with sulphuric acid. The zinc,<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Battery, Sir William Thomson's.</span><br>
A form of Daniell battery, of the gravity type. The receptacles are<br>
shallow wooden trays lined with lead. A thin plate of copper rests on<br>
the bottom. The zinc plate is of gridiron shape, and rests on wooden<br>
blocks which support it in a horizontal position above the copper. One<br>
tray is placed on top of the other, the upper tray resting on the<br>
corners of the zinc plate which rise above the level of the top of the<br>
flat vessel. Thus connection is assured without wires or binding posts.<br>
It is charged like a gravity battery. The density of the zinc sulphate<br>
solution should be between 1.10 and 1.30. The circuit must be kept<br>
closed to prevent deposition of metallic copper on the zinc. The entire<br>
disposition of the battery is designed to reduce resistance.<br>

A primary voltaic cell, the invention of A. Ren&eacute;e Upward.
Referring to<br>
the cuts, the positive plate. Z, is of cast zinc; it is immersed in<br>
water, in a porous cup, B. Outside of the porous cup and contained in<br>
the battery jar are two carbon plates, C, C, connected together. The<br>
rest of the space between the porous cup and battery jar is packed with<br>
crushed carbon, and the top is cemented. Chlorine gas is led by a pipe,<br>
D, into the outer cell. It diffuses through the fine carbon, dissolves<br>
in the water, and so finds its way to the zinc, which it attacks,<br>
directly combining therewith, and forming zinc chloride (Zn + 2 Cl = Zn<br>
Cl 2). Such of the chlorine as is not absorbed finds its way by an
outlet<br>
tube, E, to the next cell. Arrangements are provided for generating<br>
chlorine gas as required. The high specific gravity of the gas is<br>
utilized in regulating its distribution through the cells. The<br>
electro-motive force of the cell is 2.1 volts. A cell 11.5 by 5.5 inches<br>
and 12.5 inches deep has a resistance of 0.2 ohm.<br>

<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Battery, Volta's.</span><br>
The original acid battery. It has a negative electrode of copper, a<br>
positive electrode of zinc; the excitant is sulphuric acid diluted with<br>
sixteen times its volume of water. It rapidly polarizes, and is very<br>
little used.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Battery, Voltaic or Galvanic.</span><br>
An apparatus for converting chemical energy directly into electric<br>
energy. This is as broad a definition as can well be given. The general<br>
conception of a battery includes the action of electrolysis, a solution<br>
in the battery acting upon one of two conducting electrodes immersed in<br>
such fluid, which dissolves one of them only, or one more than the<br>
other. The best way to obtain a fundamental idea of a battery is to<br>
start with the simplest. Dilute sulphuric acid dissolves neither pure<br>
zinc nor copper. But it has a far stronger affinity for the first named<br>
metal. If now we immerse in dilute acid two plates, one of pure zinc,<br>
and one of copper, no action will be discernible. But if the plates are<br>
brought in contact with each other a stream of bubbles of hydrogen gas<br>
will escape from the surface of the copper and the zinc will dissolve.<br>
By applying proper tests and deductions it will be found that the copper<br>
and zinc are being constantly charged with opposite electricities, and<br>
that these are constantly recombining. This recombination produces what<br>
is known as an electric current.<br>
<br>
To constitute a battery the zinc and copper plates must be connected<br>
outside of the solution. This connection need not be immediate. Any<br>
conductor which touches both plates will bring about the action, and the<br>
current will pass through it.<br>
<br>
The easiest way to picture the action of a battery is to accept the<br>
doctrine of contact action. In the battery the molecules of water are<br>
pulled apart. The hydrogen molecules go to the copper, the oxygen<br>
molecules go to the zinc, each one, leaving its contact with the other,<br>
comes off charged with opposite electricity. This charges the plates,<br>
and the continuous supply of charge and its continuous discharge<br>
establishes the current.<br>
<br>
The accumulation of hydrogen acts to stop the action by polarization.<br>
Its own affinity for oxygen acts against or in opposition to the<br>
affinity of the zinc for the same element, and so cuts down the action.<br>
A depolarizer of some kind is used in acid batteries for this reason. As<br>
such depolarizer has only to act upon one plate, in most batteries it is<br>
usual to surround such plate only, as far as it is possible, with the<br>
depolarizer. The solution which dissolves the zinc is termed the<br>
excitant or exciting solution.<br>
<br>
To this concrete notion of a voltaic battery the different modifications<br>
described here may be referred. Zinc, it will be seen, forms the almost<br>
universally used dissolved plate; carbon or copper forms the most usual<br>
undissolved plate; sulphuric acid in one form or another is the most<br>
usual excitant.<br>
<br>
The solution in a voltaic battery is electrolyzed (see Electrolysis).<br>
Hence the solutions must be electrolytes. The sulphuric acid and other<br>
ingredients play a secondary role as imparting to the battery fluids<br>
this characteristic.<br>
<br>
It is not necessary to have electrodes of different substances, the same<br>
metal maybe used for both if they are immersed in different solutions<br>
which act differentially upon them, or which act with more energy on one<br>
than on the other. Such are only of theoretical interest.<br>
<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Battery, Water.</span><br>
A voltaic battery, whose exciting fluid is water. They are used for<br>
charging quadrant electrometer needles and similar purposes. They<br>
polarize very quickly and are of high resistance. Hence very small<br>
plates in large number can be used without impairing their advantage.<br>
<br>
Rowland's water battery dispenses with cups and uses capillarity<br>
instead. The zinc and platinum or copper plates of a couple are placed<br>
very close together, while the couples are more distant. On dipping into<br>
water each couple picks up and retains by capillarity a little water<br>
between its plates, which forms the exciting fluid. Many hundred couples<br>
can be mounted on a board, and the whole is charged by dipping into<br>
water and at once removing therefrom. It then develops its full<br>
potential difference.<br>

<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Bell, Electric.</span><br>
A bell rung by electricity. Generally it is worked by a current exciting<br>
an electro-magnet, attracting or releasing an armature which is attached<br>
to the vibrating or pivoted tongue of the bell. It may be worked by a<br>
distant switch or press-button, q. v., ringing once for each movement of<br>
the distant switch, etc., or it may be of the vibrating bell type as<br>
shown in the cut. When the current is turned on in this case it attracts<br>
the armature. As this moves towards the poles of the magnet it breaks<br>
the circuit by drawing the contact spring, q. v., away from the contact<br>
point, q. v. This opens the circuit, to whose continuity the contact of<br>
these two parts is essential. The hammer, however, by its momentum<br>
strikes the bell and at once springs back. This again makes the contact<br>
and the hammer is reattracted. This action continues as long as the<br>
circuit is closed at any distant point to which it may be carried. The<br>
ordinary vibrating bell is a typical automatic circuit breaker, q. v.,<br>
this type keeping up the ringing as long as the circuit is closed. Other<br>
bells have no electric contact and simply ring once every time the<br>
circuit is closed. Others worked by an alternating current ring once for<br>
each change of direction of current.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Blasting, Electric.</span><br>
The ignition of blasting charges of powder or high explosives by the<br>
electric spark, or by the ignition to incandescence (red or white heat)<br>
of a thin wire immersed in or surrounded by powder. Special influence or<br>
frictional electric machines or induction coils are used to produce<br>
sparks, if that method of ignition is employed. For the incandescent<br>
wire a hand magneto is very generally employed. (See Fuse, Electric.)<br>
<br>
The cuts, Figs. 62 and 63, show one form of incandescent wire fuse. The<br>
large wires are secured to the capsule, so that no strand can come upon<br>
the small wire within the cavity.<br>
<br>
The cut, Fig. 64, shows a frictional electric machine for igniting spark<br>
fuses.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Bleaching, Electric.</span><br>
Bleaching by agents produced or made available by the direct action of<br>
electricity. Thus if a current under proper conditions is sent through a<br>
solution of common salt (sodium chloride), the electrodes being close<br>
together, the salt is decomposed, chlorine going to one pole and sodium<br>
hydrate to the other. The two substances react upon each other and<br>
combine, forming sodium hypochlorite, which bleaches the tissue immersed<br>
in its solution.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Block System.</span><br>
A system of signalling on railroads. The essence of the system consists<br>
in having signal posts or stations all along the road at distances<br>
depending on the traffic. The space between each two signal posts is<br>
termed a block. From the signal posts the trains in day time are<br>
signalled by wooden arms termed semaphores, and at night by lanterns.<br>
The arms may be moved by hand or by automatic mechanism depending in<br>
part on electricity for carrying out its functions. Thus in the<br>
Westinghouse system the semaphores are moved by pneumatic cylinders and<br>
pistons, whose air valves are opened and shut by the action of solenoid<br>
magnets, q. v. The current of these magnets is short circuited by<br>
passing trains, so as to let the valves close as the train passes the<br>
signal post. The block system causes the semaphore to be set at "danger"<br>
or "caution," as the train enters the next block. Then the following<br>
train is not allowed to enter the block until the safety signal is<br>
shown. The Westinghouse system provides for two semaphores on a post,<br>
one indicating "danger" as long as the train is on the next block; the<br>
other indicating "caution" as long as the train is on the next two<br>
blocks. The rails form part of the circuit, their joints being bridged<br>
by copper wire throughout the block, and being insulated where the<br>
blocks meet.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Block Wire.</span><br>
In the block system a wire connecting adjacent block-signal towers or<br>
semaphore poles.<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Blow-pipe.</span><br>
A name sometimes given to an electric experiment illustrating the<br>
repulsion of electrified air particles from a point held at high<br>
relative potential. A metallic point, placed on the prime conductor of<br>
an electric friction or influence machine, becomes highly electrified,<br>
and the air becoming excited is repelled and acts upon the candle flame.<br>
If the candle is placed on the conductor and a point held towards it the<br>
repulsion is still away from the point.<br>

A name sometimes given to devices for using the voltaic arc to produce<br>
local heating effects. The directive action of the magnet may be used to<br>
force out the arc like a blow-pipe flame, or a blast of air may be<br>
directly applied for the same purpose.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Boat, Electric.</span><br>
A boat propelled by electricity. The electricity drives a motor which<br>
actuates a screw propeller. The current is generally supplied by a<br>
storage battery. When used on rivers charging stations are established<br>
at proper places. When the boat is used as a tender or launch for a<br>
steam ship, such as a war-vessel, the battery is charged by a plant on<br>
board the ship. From their noiselessness electric boats are peculiarly<br>
available for nocturnal torpedo operations, and the universal equipment<br>
of modern war-ships with electric lightning and power plants makes their<br>
use possible at all points. This type is often termed an electric<br>
launch, and most or all electric boats fall under this category.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Bobbins.</span><br>
A spool of wood or other material wound with insulated wire. In a<br>
tangent galvanometer the bobbin becomes a ring, with a channel to<br>
receive the winding. As the ring is not infinitely large compared to the<br>
needle the tangent law is not absolutely fulfilled. It is most<br>
accurately fulfilled (S. P. Thomson) when the depth of the groove or<br>
channel in the radial direction bears to the breadth in the axial<br>
direction the ratio of square root of 3 to the square root of 2 or<br>
approximately 11 : 9<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Body Protector.</span><br>
A metallic short circuit connected with the wrists and lower legs of the<br>
human body, so that if by accident an active circuit is grounded by the<br>
hands and body of the workman wearing it, most of the current will pass<br>
through the wire conductors, thus avoiding the vital organs of the body.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Boiler Feed, Electric.</span><br>
An apparatus by which an electric current acting on an electro-magnet,<br>
or other equivalent device, opens the water supply when the water level<br>
in a boiler sinks too low, and cuts off the water supply as the water<br>
level rises.<br>
<br>

the British Association.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Bolometer.</span><br>
An apparatus for detecting small amounts of radiant energy (radiant<br>
heat, so called). A coil suspended by a fine wire or filament so as to<br>
be free to rotate under the effect of force is made up of two parallel<br>
and equal wires, insulated from each other, but connected so that<br>
parallel currents sent through them go in opposite direction through<br>
each. This coil is hung in a strong electro-magnetic field produced by a<br>
large coil surrounding it. When a current passes through the suspended<br>
coil no effect will follow, because the oppositely wound portions<br>
counteract each other exactly. In the circuit with one half of the<br>
suspended coil is an exceedingly thin strip of platinum wire. The other<br>
half of the coil has no strips. Both halves unite after leaving the<br>
coil. If now the strip of platinum is heated its conductivity is<br>
affected and its half of the coil receives less current than the other<br>
half. This disturbs the balance and the coil swings through a small arc.<br>
This apparatus may be made very sensitive, so that an increase of<br>
temperature of 1/1400&ordm; F., 9/70000&deg;C. (1/14000&ordm; F.) will
be perceptible.<br>
Another construction takes the form of a Wheatstone Bridge, q. v., in<br>
whose arms are introduced resistances consisting of bands of iron, .5<br>
Millimeter wide (.02 inches), .004 millimeter (.00016 inch) thick, and<br>
folded on themselves 14 times so as to make a rectangular grating, 17 x<br>
12 millimeters (.68 x .48 inch). The least difference of heat applied to<br>
the grating affects the galvanometer.<br>

<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Box Bridge.</span><br>
A constriction of Wheatstone's Bridge in which the necessary resistance<br>
coils are contained in a single box with plugs for throwing the coils in<br>
and out of circuit, and connections to bring the coils into the<br>
different arms of the system. The cut shows a box bridge. Connections<br>
for the galvanometer, battery wires, and terminals of the unknown<br>
resistance are provided, by which its resistances and the connections<br>
are brought into the exact relations indicated in the conventional<br>
diagram of Wheatstone's bridge. (See Wheatstone's Bridge.)<br>
<br>
Referring to the cut, the battery wire, say from the zinc plate,<br>
connects at A1, thereby reaching A, its true connecting point. To B1 one<br>
end of the galvanometer circuit or lead is attached, thereby reaching B,<br>
its true connecting point. To C are connected the other end from the<br>
galvanometer and one end of the unknown resistance. The other end of the<br>
unknown resistance, and the other end of the battery wire, in this case<br>
from the carbon plate, connect to D. At G is an infinity plug, as it is<br>
called. When out it breaks the circuit.<br>
<br>
In use after the connections are made the key is depressed and the<br>
galvanometer observed. The resistance is changed until no action of the<br>
galvanometer is produced by closing the circuit when the ratio of the<br>
resistances of the arms gives the proportion for calculating the unknown<br>
resistances.<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Branch Block.</span><br>
In electric wiring of buildings, a block of porcelain or other material<br>
with grooves, holes and screws for the connection of branch wires to a<br>
main wire. Its functions are not only to afford a basis for connecting<br>
the wires, but also to contain safety fuses. As when a branch wire is<br>
taken off, fuses have to be put in its line, the branch block carries<br>
these also. One end of each fuse connects with a main wire, the other<br>
end connects with one of the wires of the branch leader or wire.<br>
<br>
Porcelain is a favorite material for them, as the fusing or "blowing<br>
out" of the safety fuses cannot set it on fire.<br>

between the third brush circuit and the regular circuit, and by varying<br>
the position of this contact regulation is obtained.<br>
<br>
It is to be distinguished from the pilot brush used for determining the<br>
characteristic of the commutator, although based on the same general<br>
principles.<br>

A buoy for use to indicate channels or dangers in harbors and elsewhere,<br>
which carries an electric light, whose current is supplied by cable from<br>
shore. It has been proposed to use glass tubes exhausted of air and<br>
containing mercury, which, as moved by the waves, would produce a<br>
luminous effect. A fifty-candle power incandescent lamp is an approved<br>
source of light.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Burner, Electric Gas.</span><br>
A gas burner arranged for the flame to be lighted by electricity. It<br>
takes a great variety of forms. In some cases a pair of terminals are<br>
arranged near the flame or a single terminal is placed near the metal<br>
tip, the latter forming one of the terminals. The spark is generally<br>
produced by an induction coil, or a spark coil. The gas may first be<br>
turned on and the spark then passed. Sometimes the turning of the gas<br>
cock of an individual burner makes and breaks a contact as it turns, and<br>
thereby produces simultaneously with the turning on of the gas a spark<br>
which lights it.<br>
<br>
Another form is wholly automatic. A pair of electro-magnets are attached<br>
below the base of the burner, one of which, when excited, turns on the<br>
gas, and the other one when it is excited turns it off. At the same time<br>
a spark is produced with the turning on of the gas so that it is<br>
lighted. Thus, by use of a automatic burner, a distant gas burner can be<br>
lighted by turning an electric switch. An out-door lamp may be lighted<br>
from within a house.<br>
<br>
The increasing use of electric incandescent lamps, lighted by the<br>
turning of a switch, tends to displace electric gas burners. The latter<br>
have been classified into a number of types depending on their<br>
construction.<br>
<br>
Burners are sometimes connected in series with leads from an induction<br>
coil. Then the gas is turned on all at once, and a succession of sparks<br>
passed until the gas is all lighted. The ignition is practically<br>
instantaneous.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Button, Push.</span><br>
A species of switch which is actuated by the pressure of a button. In<br>
its normal position the button is pressed outwards by a spring, and the<br>
circuit is open. When pressed inwards, it closes the circuit. When<br>
released it springs backward and opens the circuit again.<br>
<br>
They are principally used for ringing bells. If the latter are of the<br>
automatic type, they ring as long as the button is pressed.<br>
<br>
For door-bells and room-bells, the button often occupies the center of a<br>
rosette of wood or bronze or other ornamental piece. Sometimes, as shown<br>
in the cut, they are constructed for use on floors to be pressed by the<br>
foot. The general principle of their construction is shown, although the<br>
method of making the contact varies.<br>

supply a large number of circuits.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Cable, Aerial.</span><br>
A cable usually containing a large number of separately insulated wires,<br>
and itself insulated. It is suspended in the air. As its weight is<br>
sometimes so great that it could not well sustain it, a suspending wire<br>
is in such cases carried along with it, to which it is suspended by<br>

<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Cable, Bunched.</span><br>
A cable containing a number of separate and individual conductors. In<br>
some forms it consists virtually of two or more small cables laid<br>
tangent to each other and there secured. Thus each in section represents<br>
two or more tangent circles with the interstice solidly filled with the<br>
metal sheathing.<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Cable, Capacity of.</span><br>
The electrostatic capacity of a cable. A cable represents a Leyden jar<br>
or static condenser. The outer sheathing or armor, or even the more or<br>
less moist coating, if it is unarmored, represents one coating. The wire<br>
conductors represent the other coating, and the insulator is the<br>
dielectric.<br>
<br>
The capacity of a cable interferes with its efficiency as a conductor of<br>
broken or interrupted currents, such as are used in telegraphy or<br>
telephoning. As each impulse or momentary current is sent into the line,<br>
it has to charge the cable to at least a certain extent before the<br>
effects of the current are perceptible at the other end. Then the cable<br>
has to discharge itself. All this creates a drag or retardation.<br>
<br>
The capacity of a cable is used to determine the locality of breaks in<br>
the continuity of the conductors. The capacity per unit of length being<br>
accurately known, it is obvious that, if the conductor breaks without<br>
disturbance of the insulator, the distance of the break from the end can<br>
be ascertained by determining the capacity of the cable from one end.<br>
This capacity will be in proportion to the capacity of a mile, a knot or<br>
any fixed unit, as the distance to the break is to the length used as<br>
standard.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Calorimeter.</span><br>
An apparatus for measuring the quantity of heat evolved or produced by<br>
or under different conditions. Dulong's water calorimeter consists of a<br>
water jacket, and by the increase of temperature of the water and<br>
enclosing vessels the amount of heat produced by anything in the inner<br>
vessels is determined. The amount of ice a heated body will melt is<br>
sometimes made the basis of a calorimeter. The expansion of a fluid, as<br>
water, may be used. In the calorimeter shown in the cut the heat<br>
produced in a conductor by the passage of an electric current is caused<br>
to heat water whose temperature is shown by a thermometer immersed<br>
therein. The increase of temperature and the weight of the water give<br>
the basis for a determination of the heat produced by the current.<br>
Knowing the resistance of the conductor immersed, the watts can be<br>
calculated. This gives the bases for the determination of the<br>
heat-equivalent of electric energy. This is but an imperfect<br>
calorimeter, as it constantly would lose heat by the surrounding<br>
atmosphere, and would cease to operate as a calorimeter when the water<br>
was as hot as the wire normally would be, for then it would not absorb<br>
all the heat.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Candle, Jablochkoff.</span><br>
An arc lamp without regulating mechanism, producing an arc between the<br>
ends of parallel carbons. It consists of two parallel rods of carbon,<br>
between which is an insulating layer of non-combustible material called<br>
the colombin. Kaolin was originally employed for this part; later, as<br>
the fusion of this material was found to short- circuit the arc, a<br>
mixture of two parts of calcium sulphate and one of barium sulphate was<br>
used. The carbons are 4 millimeters (.16 inch) thick, and the colombin<br>
is 3 millimeters (.12 inch) wide and two-thirds as thick. A little slip<br>
of carbon is placed across the top, touching both carbons to start the<br>
arc. Once started the candle burns to the end, and cannot be restarted<br>
after ignition, except by placing a short conductor across the ends, as<br>
at first. The Jablochkoff candle may now be considered as virtually<br>
extinct in this country. In France at one time a great number were in<br>
use.<br>
<br>
To keep the carbons of equal length an alternating current must always<br>
be used with them. Special alternating combinations were employed in<br>
some cases where a direct current had to be drawn upon.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Candle, Jamin.</span><br>
An arc lamp with approximately parallel carbons, one of which oscillates<br>
and is controlled by an electro-magnet and armature. A coil of wire is<br>
carried around the carbons to keep the arc steady and in place. The<br>

India rubber; a substance existing in an emulsion or solution in the<br>
juice of certain trees and vines of the tropics, whence it is obtained<br>
by coagulation and drying. The name "rubber" is due to the fact that one<br>
of its earliest uses was for erasing pencil marks by rubbing. It has a<br>
very high value as an insulator. The unworked crude rubber is called<br>
virgin gum; after working over by kneading, it is termed masticated or<br>
pure gum rubber; after mixture with sulphur and heating, it is termed<br>
vulcanized rubber. If enough sulphur is added it becomes hard, and if<br>
black, is termed ebonite; if vermilion or other pigment is also added to<br>
produce a reddish color, it is termed vulcanite. The masticated gum<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Capacity, Dielectric.</span><br>
The capacity of a dielectric in retaining an electrostatic charge; the<br>
same as Specific Inductive Capacity. 'The number expressing it is<br>
sometimes called the dielectric constant. (See Capacity, Specific<br>
Inductive.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Capacity, Electric, or Electrostatic.</span><br>
The relative capacity of a conductor or system to retain a charge of<br>
electricity with the production of a given difference of potential. The<br>
greater the charge for a given change of potential, or the less the<br>
change of potential for a given charge the greater the capacity. The<br>
measure of its capacity is the amount of electricity required to raise<br>
the potential to a stated amount. The unit of capacity is the farad, q.<br>
v. Electric capacity is comparable to the capacity of a bottle for air.<br>
A given amount of air will raise the pressure more or less, and the<br>
amount required to raise its pressure a stated amount might be taken as<br>
the measure of capacity, and would be strictly comparable to<br>
electrostatic charge and potential change. The capacity, K, is obviously<br>
proportional to the quantity, Q, of the charge at a given potential, E,<br>
and inversely proportional to the potential, E, for a given quantity, Q,<br>
or,<br>
&nbsp; (1) K == Q/E<br>
&nbsp; and<br>
&nbsp; (2) Q = K * E,<br>
or, the quantity required to raise a conductor by a given potential is<br>
equal to the capacity of the conductor or system multiplied by the rise<br>
of potential. The capacity of a conductor depends upon its environments,<br>
such as the nature of the dielectric surrounding it, the proximity of<br>
oppositely charged bodies and other similar factors. (See<br>
Dielectric-Condenser-Leyden jar.)<br>
<br>
The dimensions of capacity are found by dividing a quantity of<br>
electricity by the potential produced in the conductor by such<br>
quantity.<br>
<br>
Quantity ( ((M^.5)*(L^1.5)) / T ) / potential ( ((M^.5)*(L^.5)) / T ) =

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Capacity, Instantaneous.</span><br>
The capacity of a condenser when connected only for an instant to a<br>
source of electricity. This is in contrast to electric absorption (see<br>
Absorption, Electric), and is capacity without such absorption taking<br>
part in the action.<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Capacity of a Telegraph Conductor.</span><br>
The electric capacity of a telegraphic conductor is identical in quality<br>
with that of any other conductor. It varies in quantity, not only for<br>
different wires, but for the same wire under different environments, as<br>
the wire reacting through the surrounding air or other dielectric upon<br>
the earth, represents one element of a condenser, the earth, in general,<br>
representing the other. Hence, a wire placed near the earth has greater<br>
capacity than one strung upon high poles, although the wires may be<br>
identical in length, material and diameter. The effect of high capacity<br>
is to retard the transmission of intermitting signals. Thus, when--as in<br>
the Morse system--a key is depressed, closing a long telegraph current<br>
and sending a signal into a line, it is at least very probable that a<br>
portion of the electricity travels to the end of the wire with the<br>
velocity of light. But as the wire has to be charged, enough current to<br>
move the relay may not reach the end for some seconds.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Capacity of Polarization of a Voltaic
Cell.</span><br>
The relative resistance to polarization of a voltaic cell, measured by<br>
the quantity of electricity it can supply before polarization. A<br>
counter-electromotive force may be developed, or the acid or other<br>
solution may become exhausted. The quantity of electricity delivered<br>
before this happens depends on the size and type of cell and other<br>
factors.<br>
<br>
<br>
C<span style="font-weight: bold;">apacity, Residual.</span><br>
When two insulated conductors are separated by a dielectric, and are<br>
discharged disruptively by being connected or nearly connected<br>
electrically, on removing the discharger it is found that a slight<br>
charge is present after a short interval. This is the residual charge.<br>
(See Charge, Residual.) Shaking or jarring the dielectric facilitates<br>
the complete discharge. This retaining of a charge is a phenomenon of<br>
the dielectric, and as such, is termed residual capacity. It varies<br>
greatly in different substances. In quartz it is one-ninth what it is in<br>
air. Iceland spar (crystalline calcite) seems to have no residual<br>
capacity. The action of shaking and jarring in facilitating a discharge<br>
indicates a mechanical stress into which the electrostatic polarization<br>
of the conductor has thrown the intervening dielectric.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Capacity, Specific Inductive.</span><br>
The ratio of the capacity of a condenser when its plates are separated<br>
by any substance to the capacity of the same condenser when its plates<br>
are separated by air.<br>
<br>
A static accumulator consists of two conducting surfaces separated by an<br>
insulator. It is found that the capacity of an accumulator for an<br>
electric charge, which varies with or may be rated by the potential<br>
difference to which its conductors will be brought by the given charge,<br>
varies with the nature of the interposed dielectric, and is proportional<br>
to a constant special to each substance. This constant is the specific<br>
inductive capacity of the dielectric.<br>
<br>
The same condenser will have a higher capacity as the dielectric is<br>
thinner, other things being equal. But different dielectrics having<br>
different specific inductive capacities, the constant may be determined<br>
by ascertaining the relative thicknesses of layers having the same total<br>
inductive capacity. The thicker the layer, the higher is its specific<br>
inductive capacity.<br>
<br>
Thus it is found that 3.2 units thickness of sulphur have the same total<br>
inductive capacity as 1 unit thickness of air. In other words, if<br>
sulphur is interposed between two conducting plates, they may be<br>
separated to over three times the distance that would be requisite to<br>
retain the same capacity in air. Hence, sulphur is the better<br>
dielectric, and air being taken as unity, the specific inductive<br>
capacity of sulphur is 3.2.<br>
<br>
<br>
104&nbsp;&nbsp; STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.<br>
<br>
<br>
The specific inductive capacity of a dielectric varies with the time and<br>
temperature. That of glass rises 2.5 per cent. between 12&deg; C.
(53.6&deg; F.)<br>
and 83&deg; C. (181.4&deg; F.). If a condenser is discharged
disruptively, it<br>
retains a small residual charge which it can part with later. If a<br>
metallic connection is made between the plates, the discharge is not<br>
instantaneous. Vibration shaking and jarring facilitate the complete<br>
discharge. All this shows that the charge is a phase of the dielectric<br>
itself, and indicates a strained state into which it is brought.<br>
<br>

substances:<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Capacity, Unit of.</span><br>
The unit of capacity is the capacity of a surface which a unit quantity<br>
will raise to a unit potential. The practical unit is the surface which<br>
a coulomb will raise to one volt, and is called the farad, q. v.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Capacity, Storage.</span><br>
In secondary batteries the quantity of electrical current which they can<br>
supply when charged, without undue exhaustion. It is expressed in<br>
ampere-hours. The potential varies so little during the discharge that<br>
it is assumed to be constant.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Capillarity.</span><br>
The reaction between liquid surfaces of different kinds or between<br>
liquid and solid surfaces due to surface tension. Its phenomena are<br>
greatly modified by electric charging, which alters the surface tension.<br>
Capillarity is the cause of solutions "creeping," as it is termed. Thus<br>
in gravity batteries a crust of zinc sulphate often formed over the edge<br>
of the jar due to the solution creeping and evaporating. As a liquid<br>
withdraws from a surface which it does not wet, creeping as above is<br>
prevented by coating the edge with paraffin wax, something which water<br>
does not moisten. It also causes the liquids of a battery cell to reach<br>
the connections and injure them by oxidation. The solutions creep up in<br>
the pores of the carbons of a battery and oxidize the clamps. To give<br>
good connections a disc of platinum or of lead is used for the contact<br>
as not being attacked. Another way is to dip the upper ends of the dry<br>
and warm carbons into melted paraffin wax, or to apply the wax to the<br>
hot carbons at the top, and melt it in with a hot iron.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Carbon.</span><br>
(a) One of the elements; atomic weight, 12. It exists in three<br>
allotropic modifications, charcoal, graphite and diamond. In the<br>
graphitic form it is used as an electric current conductor, as in<br>
batteries and for arc lamp, electrodes and incandescent lamp filaments.<br>
It is the only substance which conducts electricity and which cannot be<br>
melted with comparative ease by increase of current. (See Resistance.)<br>
<br>
(b) The carbon plate of a battery or rod of an arc lamp. To secure<br>
greater conductivity in lamp carbons, they are sometimes plated with<br>
nickel or with copper.<br>
<br>
(c) v. To place carbons in arc lamps. This has generally to be done once<br>
in twenty-four hours, unless the period of burning is very short.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Carbon, Artificial.</span><br>
For lamps, carbons and battery plates carbons are made by igniting,<br>
while protected from the action of the air, a mixture of carbon dust and<br>
a cementing and carbonizable substance. Lamp black may be added also.<br>
Powdered coke or gas carbon is mixed with molasses, coal tar, syrup, or<br>
some similar carbonaceous liquid. It is moulded into shape. For lamp<br>
carbons the mixture is forced from a vessel through a round aperture or<br>
die, by heavy pressure, and is cut into suitable lengths. For battery<br>
plates it may be simply pressed into moulds. The carbons are ignited in<br>
covered vessels and also covered with charcoal dust, lamp black or its<br>
equivalent. They are heated to full redness for some hours. After<br>
removal and cooling they are sometimes dipped again into the liquid used<br>
for cementing and reignited. Great care in securing pure carbon is<br>
sometimes necessary, especially for lamps. Fine bituminous coal is<br>
sometimes used, originally by Robert Bunsen, in 1838 or 1840;<br>
purification by different processes has since been applied; carbon from<br>
destructive distillation of coal tar has been used. The famous
Carr&eacute;<br>
carbons are made, it is said, from 15 parts very pure coke dust, five<br>
parts calcined lamp-black, and seven or eight parts sugar--syrup mixed<br>
with a little gum. Five hours heating, with subsequent treatment with<br>
boiling caramel and reignition are applied. The latter treatment is<br>
termed "nourishing." Napoli used three parts of coke to one of tar.<br>
Sometimes a core of different carbon than the surrounding tube is<br>
employed.<br>

At high temperatures the resistance is about one-third these amounts. A<br>
layer of copper may increase the conductivity one hundred times and<br>
prolong the duration 14 per cent. Thus a layer of copper 1/695<br>

A zinc-copper-copper sulphate couple.<br>
Many forms are used. Sometimes a number of pieces of blotting paper are<br>
interposed between two plates, one of copper--the other of zinc. The<br>
paper next the copper is soaked in copper sulphate solution, and those<br>
next the zinc in zinc sulphate solution, of course before being put<br>
together. Sometimes the ordinary porous cup combination is employed. The<br>
cut shows a modification due to Dr. Fleming (Phil. Mag. S. 5, vol. xx,<br>
p. 126), which explains itself. The U tube is 3/4-inch diameter, and 8<br>
inches long. Starting with it empty the tap A is opened, and the whole U<br>
tube filled with zinc sulphate solution, and the tap A is closed. The<br>
zinc rod usually kept in the tube L is put in place, tightly corking up<br>
its end of the U tube. The cock C is opened, which lowers the level of<br>
the solution in the right-hand limb of the U tube only. The tap B is<br>
opened and the copper sulphate solution is run in, preserving the line<br>
of separation of the two solutions. The copper rod is taken out of its<br>
tube M, and is put in place. India rubber corks are used for both rods.<br>
As the liquids begin to mix the mixture can be drawn off at C and the<br>
sharp line of demarcation re-established. In Dr. Sloane's standard cell<br>
two test tubes are employed for the solutions and a syphon is used to<br>
connect them.<br>
<br>
Oxidation of the zinc lowers the E. M. F.; oxidation of the copper<br>
raises it. With solutions of equal sp. gr. the E. M. F. is 1.104 volts.<br>
If the copper sulphate solution is 1.100 sp. gr. and the zinc sulphate<br>
solution 1.400 sp. gr., both at 15&deg; C. (59&deg;F.), the E. M. F.
will be<br>
1.074 volt. Clean pure zinc and freshly electrolyzed copper should be<br>
used.<br>

several molecules of the body always passes through it. These are <br>
resultants of the relative moments of the molecules. If a body is <br>

<br>
under its point of suspension. By two trials the point of intersection <br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Characteristic Curve.</span><br>
A curve indicating the variations in electro-motive force developed<br>
during the rotations of the armature of a dynamo or other generator of<br>
E. M. F. The term as used in the electrical sense is thus applied,<br>
although the indicator diagram of a steam engine may be termed its<br>
characteristic curve, and so in many other cases. As the amperes taken<br>
from a series generator are increased in number, the E. M. F. rises, it<br>
may be very rapidly up to a certain point, and thereafter more slowly.<br>
To construct the curve coordinates, q. v., are employed. The resistance<br>
of the dynamo and of the outer circuit being known, the current<br>
intensity is measured. To obtain variations in electro-motive force the<br>
external resistance is changed. Thus a number of ampere readings with<br>
varying known resistance are obtained, and for each one an<br>
electro-motive force is calculated by Ohm's law. From these data a curve<br>
is plotted, usually with volts laid off on the ordinate and amperes on<br>
the abscissa.<br>

By other methods other characteristic curves may be obtained, for which<br>
the titles under Curve may be consulted.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Charge, Bound.</span><br>
A charge of electricity borne by the surface of a body so situated with<br>
reference to another oppositely charged body, that the charge is<br>
imperceptible to ordinary test, will not affect an electroscope nor<br>
leave the surface if the latter is connected to the earth. To discharge<br>
such a body it must be connected to its complimentarily charged body.<br>
The bound charge was formerly called dissimulated or latent electricity.<br>
(See Charge, Free.)<br>
<br>
The charge or portion of a charge of a surface which is neutralized<br>
inductively by a neighboring charge of opposite kind. The degree of<br>
neutralization or of binding will depend on the distance of the two<br>
charged surfaces from one another and on the electro-static nature of<br>
the medium intervening, which must of necessity be a dielectric. A<br>
charge not so held or neutralized is termed a free charge. Thus a<br>
surface may be charged and by the approach of a surface less highly<br>
charged may have part of its charge bound. Then if connected to earth.<br>
it will part with its unbound or free charge, but will retain the other<br>
until the binding surface is removed, or until the electricity of such<br>
surface is itself bound, or discharged, or until connection is made<br>
between the two surfaces. Thus a body may have both a bound and a free<br>
charge at the same time.<br>

The relative quantity of electricity upon a given surface. Thus a<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Charge, Distribution of.</span><br>
The relation of densities of charge on different parts of a charged<br>
body. On a spherical conductor the charge is normally of even<br>
distribution; on other conductors it is unevenly distributed, being of<br>
greatest density at points, edges, and parts of smallest radius of<br>
curvature. Even distribution can also be disturbed by local induction,<br>
due to the presence of oppositely charged bodies.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Charge, Free.</span><br>
The charge borne by an insulated body, independent of surrounding<br>
objects. Theoretically it is an impossibility. A charge always has its<br>
compliment somewhere in surrounding objects. As a matter of convenience<br>
and convention, where the complimentary charge is so distributed that<br>
its influence is not perceptible the charge is called a free charge. If<br>
connected to earth the free charge will leave the body. If the body is<br>
connected with an electroscope the free charge will affect the same.<br>
(See Charge, Bound.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Charge, Residual.</span><br>
When a Leyden jar or other condenser is discharged by the ordinary<br>
method, after a few minutes standing a second discharge of less amount<br>
can be obtained from it. This is due to what is known as the residual<br>
charge. It seems to be connected in some way with the mechanical or<br>
molecular distortion of the dielectric. The jarring of the dielectric<br>
after discharge favors the rapidity of the action, diminishing the time<br>
required for the appearance of the residual charge. The phenomenon, it<br>
will be seen, is analogous to residual magnetism. This charge is the<br>
reciprocal of electric absorption and depends for its amount upon the<br>
nature of the dielectric. (See Absorption, Electric, and Capacity,<br>
Residual.)<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Chemical Change.</span><br>
When bodies unite in the ratio of their chemical equivalents, so as to<br>
represent the satisfying of affinity or the setting free of thermal or<br>
other energy, which uniting is generally accompanied by sensible heat<br>
and often by light, as in the ignition of a match, burning of a candle,<br>
and, when the new compound exhibits new properties distinct from those<br>
of its components, a chemical combination is indicated. More definitely<br>
it is a change of relation of the atoms. Another form of chemical change<br>
is decomposition, the reverse of combination, and requiring or absorbing<br>
energy and producing several bodies of properties distinct from those of<br>
the original compound. Thus in a voltaic battery chemical combination<br>
and decomposition take place, with evolution of electric instead of<br>
thermal energy.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Chemical Equivalent.</span><br>
The quotient obtained by dividing the atomic weight, q. v., of an<br>
element by its valency, q. v. Thus the atomic weight of oxygen is 16,<br>
its valency is 2. its chemical equivalent is 8. It is the weight of the<br>
element corresponding to a unit weight of hydrogen, either as replacing<br>
it, or combining with it. In electro-chemical calculations the chemical<br>
equivalent is often conveniently used to avoid the necessity of dividing<br>
by the valency when atomic weights are used. The latter is really the<br>
better practice. The atomic weights in the old system of chemical<br>
nomenclature were chemical equivalents.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Chemical Recorder.</span><br>
A form of telegraphic recorder in which the characters, often of the<br>
Morse alphabet or some similar one, are inscribed on chemically prepared<br>
paper by decomposition affecting the compound with which the paper is<br>
charged. In the original chemical recorder of Bain, the instrument was<br>
somewhat similar to the Morse recorder, except that the motionless<br>
stylus, S, always pressing against the paper was incapable of making any<br>
mark, but being of iron, and the paper strip being impregnated with<br>
potassium ferrocyanide, on the passage of a current a stain of Prussian<br>
blue was produced where the stylus touched the paper. The current passes<br>
from the line by way of the iron stylus, through the paper, and by way<br>
of a brass surface, M, against which the paper is held and is pressed by<br>
the stylus, to the earth. This recorder is extremely simple and has no<br>
part to be moved by the current. The solution in which the paper is<br>
dipped contains a mixture of potassium ferrocyanide and ammonium<br>
nitrate. The object of the latter is to keep the paper moist. In recent<br>
recorders a solution of potassium iodide has been used, which gives a<br>
brown stain of free iodine, when the current passes. This stain<br>
disappears in a few days.<br>

An apparatus employed to illustrate the principles of the electrostatic<br>
charge, involving the ringing of bells by electrostatic attraction and<br>
repulsion. It is used in connection with a frictional, or influence<br>
electric machine. Two bells are employed with a button or clapper<br>
suspended between them. One bell is connected to one of the prime<br>
conductors, q. v., of the machine. The other insulated therefrom is<br>
connected to earth, or if an influence machine is used, to the other<br>
prime conductor. The clappers are hung by a silk thread, so as to be<br>
entirely insulated. On working the machine the bells become oppositely<br>
excited. A clapper is attracted to one, then when charged is repelled<br>
and attracted to the other, it gives up its charge and becoming charged<br>
with similar electricity to that of the bell it touches, is repelled and<br>
attracted to the other, and this action is kept up as long as the<br>
excitement continues, the bells ringing continuously.<br>

An apparatus for indicating electrically, and thereby measuring, the<br>
lapse of time. The periods measured may be exceedingly short, such as<br>
the time a photographic shutter takes to close, the time required by a<br>
projectile to go a certain distance, and similar periods.<br>
<br>
A drum rotated with even and known velocity may be marked by a stylus<br>
pressed upon it by the action of an electro-magnet when a key is<br>
touched, or other disturbance. Then the space between two marks would<br>
give the period elapsing between the two disturbances of the circuit. As<br>
it is practically impossible to secure even rotation of a drum, it is<br>
necessary to constantly measure its rate of rotation. This is effected<br>
by causing a tuning-fork of known rate of vibration to be maintained in<br>
vibration electrically. A fine point or bristle attached to one of its<br>
arms, marks a sinuous line upon the smoked surface of the cylinder. This<br>
gives the basis for most accurately determining the smallest intervals.<br>
Each wave drawn by the fork corresponds to a known fraction of a second.<br>
<br>
For projectiles, the cutting of a wire opens a circuit, and the opening<br>
is recorded instead of the closing. By firing so as to cut two wires at<br>
a known distance apart the rate is obtained by the chronograph.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Circuit.</span><br>
A conducting path for electric currents properly forming a complete path<br>
with ends joined and including generally a generating device of some<br>
kind. Part of the conduction may be true and part electrolytic. (See<br>
Electrolytic Conduction.) The term has become extended, so that the term<br>
is often applied to any portion of a circuit conveniently considered by<br>
itself. The simplest example of a complete circuit would be a circular<br>
conductor. If rotated in the earth's field so as to cut its lines of<br>
force a current would go through it, and it would be an electric<br>
circuit. Another example is a galvanic battery with its ends connected<br>
by a wire. Here the battery generates the current which, by electrolytic<br>
conduction, goes through the battery and by true conduction through the<br>
wire. For an example of a portion of a circuit spoken of as "a circuit"<br>
see Circuit, Astatic.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Circuit, Astatic.</span><br>
A circuit so wound with reference to the direction of the currents<br>
passing through it that the terrestrial or other lines of force have no<br>
directive effect upon it, one member counteracting the other. It may be<br>
produced by making the wire lie in two closed curves, A and B, each<br>
enclosing an equal area, one of identical shape and disposition with the<br>
other, and with the current circulating in opposite directions in each<br>
one. Thus each circuit represents a magnetizing turn of opposite<br>
polarity and counteracting each other's directive tendency exhibited in<br>
a field of force with reference to an axis a c. Another form of astatic<br>
circuit is shown in Fig. 86. The portions C, D, lying on opposite sides<br>
of the axis of rotation a c, are oppositely acted on by the earth's<br>
directive force as regards the direction of their rotation.<br>

Any apparatus for opening and closing a circuit is thus termed, but it<br>

is the hammer and anvil of the induction coil. (See Induction Coil;<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Circuit, Electric, Active.</span><br>
A circuit through which a current passes. The circuit itself need only<br>
be a conducting ring, or endless wire. Generally it includes, as part of<br>
the circuit, a generator of electro-motive force, and through which<br>
generator by conduction, ordinary or electrolytic, the same current goes<br>
that passes through the rest of the circuit. One and the same current<br>
passes through all parts of a series circuit when such current is<br>
constant.<br>
<br>
A current being produced by electro-motive force, and electromotive<br>
force disappearing in its production in an active circuit, there must be<br>
some source of energy which will maintain electromotive force against<br>
the drain made upon it by the current.<br>
<br>
The simplest conception of an active electric circuit is a ring or<br>
endless conductor swept through a field of force so as to cut lines of<br>
force. A simple ring dropped over a magnet pole represents the<br>
simplification of this process. In such a ring a current, exceedingly<br>
slight, of course, will be produced. In this case there is no generator<br>
in the circuit. An earth coil (see Coil, Earth,) represents such a<br>
circuit, with the addition, when experimented with, of a galvanometer in<br>
the circuit.<br>

In practice, a circuit includes a generator such as a battery or dynamo,<br>
and by conductors is led through a continuous path. Electric lamps,<br>
electrolytic cells, motors and the like may be included in it.<br>

the earth, so that the earth completes the circuit. In telegraphy each<br>
end of the line is grounded or connected to an earth-plate, q. v., or to<br>
the water or gas-pipes, and the current is assumed to go through the<br>
earth on its return. It really amounts to a discharging at one end, and<br>
charging at the other end of the line. The resistance of the earth is<br>
zero, but the resistance of the grounding or connection with the earth<br>
may be considerable.<br>

Cleats.<br>
A support; a short block of wood, grooved transversely, for holding<br>
electric wires against a wall. For the three wire system three grooves<br>
are used. The entire wiring of apartments is sometimes done by the<br>
"cleat system," using cleats instead of battens, q. v., or mouldings.<br>
The cleats are secured against the wall with the grooves facing it, and<br>
the wires are introduced therein.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Clock, Electrolytic.</span><br>
A clock worked by the electrolytic deposition and resolution of a<br>
deposit of metal upon a disc. It is the invention of Nikola Tesla. A<br>
metallic disc is mounted on a transverse axis, so as to readily rotate.<br>
It is immersed in a vessel of copper sulphate. A current is passed<br>
through the bath, the terminals or electrodes being near to and facing<br>
the opposite edges of the disc, so that the line connecting the<br>
electrodes lies in the plane of the disc. If a current is passed through<br>
the solution by the electrodes, copper is deposited on one side of the<br>
disc, and as it rotates under the influence of the weight thus<br>
accumulated on one side, the same metal as it is brought to the other<br>
side of the disc is redissolved. Thus a continuous rotation is<br>
maintained. The cause of the deposition and solution is the position of<br>
the disc; one-half becomes negative and the other positive in their<br>
mutual relations.<br>

is employed in the Serrin, and in the Gramme regulators, among others.<br>
The carbons, if they approach, move clockwork. The movement of this is<br>
stopped or freed by an electro-magnet placed in shunt around the arc<br>
and carbons.<br>

<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Clutch.</span><br>
In arc lamps a device for the feed of the upper carbons. In its simplest<br>
form it is simply a plate or bar pierced with a hole through which the<br>
carbon passes loosely. The action of the mechanism raises or lowers one<br>
end of the plate or bar. As it rises it binds and clutches the carbon,<br>
and if the action continues it lifts it a little. When the same end is<br>
lowered the carbon and clutch descend together until the opposite end of<br>
the clutch being prevented from further descent, the clutch approaches<br>
the horizontal position and the rod drops bodily through the aperture.<br>
The cut shows the clutches of the Brush double carbon lamp. In practice<br>
the lifting and releasing as regulated by an electro-magnet are so very<br>
slight that practically an almost absolutely steady feed is secured. A<br>
similar clutch is used in the Weston lamp.<br>

A clutch or appliance for connecting a shaft to a source of rotary<br>
motion while the latter is in action. In one form a disc, in whose face<br>
a groove has been formed, which groove is filled with a coil of wire, is<br>
attached to the loose wheel, while the shaft carries a flat plate to act<br>
as armature. On turning on the current the flat plate is attached,<br>
adheres, and causes its wheel to partake of the motion of the shaft.<br>
Contact is made by brushes and collecting rings.<br>

In the cut, A A is the attracted disc; the brushes, B B, take current to<br>
the collecting rings, C. The magnetizing coil is embedded in the body of<br>
the pulley, as shown.<br>

Conductor.</span><br>
The thin conducting coatings of tinfoil, gold leaf or other conducting<br>
substance, enabling the surface to receive and part with the electric<br>
charge readily. Without such a coating the charge and discharge would be<br>

A telegraphic alphabet. (See Alphabets, Telegraphic.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Coefficient.</span><br>
In algebra, the numerical multiplier of a symbol, as in the expression<br>
"5x," 5 is the coefficient. In physics, generally a number expressing<br>
the ratio or relation between quantities, one of which is often unity,<br>
as a standard or base of the set of coefficients. Thus the coefficient<br>
of expansion by heat of any substance is obtained by dividing its volume<br>
for a given degree of temperature by its volume at the standard<br>
temperature as 0&ordm; C., or 32&ordm; F. This gives a fraction by
which if any<br>
volume of a substance, taken at 0&ordm; C., or at whatever may be taken
as<br>
the basic temperature, is multiplied, the expanded volume for the given<br>
change of temperature will be obtained as the product. A coefficient<br>
always in some form implies the idea of a multiplier. Thus the<br>
coefficient of an inch referred to a foot would be 1/12 or .833+,<br>
because any number of inches multiplied by that fraction would give the<br>
corresponding number of feet.<br>
<br>
[Transcriber's note: 1/12 is 0.0833+]<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Coefficient, Economic.</span><br>
In machinery, electric generators, prime motors and similar structures,<br>
the number expressing the ratio between energy absorbed by the device,<br>
and useful, not necessarily available, work obtained from it. It is<br>
equal to work obtained divided by energy absorbed, and is necessarily a<br>
fraction. If it exceeded unity the doctrine of the conservation of<br>
energy would not be true. The economic coefficient expresses the<br>
efficiency, q. v., of any machine, and of efficiencies there are several<br>
kinds, to express any one of which the economic coefficient may be used.<br>
Thus, let W--energy absorbed, and w = work produced ; then w/W is the<br>
economic coefficient, and for each case would be expressed numerically.<br>
(See Efficiency, Commercial--Efficiency, Electrical--Efficiency of<br>
Conversion.)<br>
<br>
The distinction between useful and available work in a dynamo is as<br>
follows: The useful work would include the work expended by the field,<br>
and the work taken from the armature by the belt or other mechanical<br>
connection. Only the latter would be the available work.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Coercive or Coercitive Force.</span><br>
The property of steel or hard iron, in virtue of which it slowly takes<br>
up or parts with magnetic force, is thus termed ("traditionally";<br>
Daniell). It seems to have to do with the positions of the molecules, as<br>
jarring a bar of steel facilitates its magnetization or accelerates its<br>
parting, when not in a magnetic field, with its permanent or residual<br>
magnetism. For this reason a permanent magnet should never be jarred,<br>
and permitting the armature to be suddenly attracted and to strike<br>
against it with a jar injures its attracting power.<br>
<br>
Coercive force is defined also as the amount of negative magnetizing<br>
force required to reduce remnant magnetism to zero.<br>
<br>
By some authorities the term is entirely rejected, as the phenomenon<br>
does not seem directly a manifestation of force.<br>

An arrangement of coil and plunger in which two plungers or one plunger<br>
are acted on by two coils, wound so as to act oppositely or<br>
differentially on the plunger or plungers. Thus one coil may be in<br>
parallel with the other, and the action on the plunger will then depend<br>
on the relative currents passing through the coils.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Coil, Choking.</span><br>
A coil of high self-induction, used to resist the intensity of or<br>
"choke" alternating currents. Any coil of insulated wire wound around<br>
upon a laminated or divided iron core forms a choking coil. The iron<br>
coil is usually so shaped as to afford a closed magnetic circuit.<br>
<br>
A converter or transformer acts as a choking coil as long as its<br>
secondary is left open. In alternating current work special choking<br>
coils are used. Thus for theatrical work, a choking coil with a movable<br>
iron core is used to change the intensity of the lights. It is in<br>
circuit with the lamp leads. By thrusting in the core the self-induction<br>
is increased and the current diminishes, lowering the lamps; by<br>
withdrawing it the self-induction diminishes, and the current increases.<br>
Thus the lamps can be made to gradually vary in illuminating power like<br>
gas lights, when turned up or down.<br>

an adjoining circuit, or in a circuit, part of which adjoins the<br>
original circuit, or adjoins part of it.<br>
<br>
An induction coil comprises three principal parts, the core, the primary<br>
coil and the secondary coil. If it is to be operated by a steady<br>
current, means must be provided for varying it or opening and closing<br>
the primary circuit. A typical coil will be described.<br>
<br>
<br>
134&nbsp;&nbsp; STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.<br>
<br>
<br>
The core is a mass of soft iron preferably divided to prevent extensive<br>
Foucault currents. A cylindrical bundle of soft iron wires is generally<br>
used. Upon this the primary coil of reasonably heavy wire, and of one or<br>
two layers in depth, is wrapped, all being carefully insulated with<br>
shellac and paper where necessary. The secondary coil is wrapped upon or<br>
over the primary. It consists of very fine wire; No. 30 to 36 is about<br>
the ordinary range. A great many turns of this are made. In general<br>
terms the electro-motive force developed by the secondary stands to that<br>
of the primary terminals in the ratio of the windings. This is only<br>
approximate.<br>
<br>
The greatest care is required in the insulating. The secondary is<br>
sometimes wound in sections so as to keep those parts differing greatly<br>
in potential far from each other. This prevents sparking, which would<br>
destroy the insulation.<br>
<br>
A make and break, often of the hammer and anvil type, is operated by the<br>
coil. (See Circuit Breaker, Automatic.) As the current passes through<br>
the primary it magnetizes the core. This attracts a little hammer which<br>
normally resting on an anvil completes the circuit. The hammer as<br>
attracted is lifted from the anvil and breaks the circuit. The soft iron<br>
core at once parts with its magnetism and the hammer falls upon the<br>
anvil again completing the circuit. This operation goes on rapidly, the<br>
circuit being opened and closed in quick succession.<br>
<br>
Every closing of the primary circuit tends to produce a reverse current<br>
in the secondary, and every opening of the primary circuit tends to<br>
produce a direct current in the secondary. Both are of extremely short<br>
duration, and the potential difference of the two terminals of the<br>
secondary may be very high if there are many times more turns in the<br>
secondary than in the primary.<br>
<br>
The extra currents interfere with the action of an induction coil. To<br>
avoid their interference a condenser is used. This consists of two<br>
series of sheets of tin foil. Leaves of paper alternate with the sheets<br>
of tin-foil, the whole being built up into a little book. Each sheet of<br>
tin-foil connects electrically with the sheet next but one to it. Thus<br>
each leaf of a set is in connection with all others of the same set, but<br>
is insulated from the others. One set of leaves of tin-foil connects<br>
with the hammer, the other with the anvil. In large coils there may be<br>
75 square feet of tin-foil in the condenser.<br>
<br>
The action of the condenser is to dispose of the direct extra current.<br>
When the primary circuit is opened this current passes into the<br>
condenser, which at once discharges itself in the other direction<br>
through the coil. This demagnetizes the core, and the action intensifies<br>
and shortens the induced current. The condenser prevents sparking, and<br>
in general improves the action of the coil.<br>
<br>
Many details enter into the construction of coils, and many variations<br>
in their construction obtain. Thus a mercury cup into which a plunger<br>
dips often replaces the anvil and hammer.<br>
<br>
<br>

The induction coil produces a rapid succession of sparks, which may<br>
spring across an interval of forty inches. The secondary generally ends<br>
in special terminals or electrodes between which the sparking takes<br>
place. A plate of glass, two inches in thickness, can be pierced by<br>
them. In the great Spottiswoode coil there are 280 miles of wire in the<br>
secondary, and the wire is about No. 36 A.W.G.<br>

An induction coil arranged to have a lower electro-motive force in the<br>

Bridge), or simply to reduce the intensity of a current. For the first<br>
class of work the coils are wound so as to prevent the creation of a<br>
magnetic field. This is effected by first doubling the wire without<br>
breaking it, and then starting at the bend the doubled wire, which is<br>
insulated, is wound on a bobbin or otherwise until a proper resistance<br>
is shown by actual measurement. The coils are generally contained or set<br>
in closed boxes with ebonite tops. Blocks of brass are placed on the<br>
top, and one end from one coil and one end from the next connect with<br>
the same block. By inserting a plug, P, so as to connect any two blocks,<br>
which have grooves reamed out for the purpose, the coil beneath will be<br>
short circuited. German silver, platinoid or other alloy, q. v., is<br>
generally the material of the wire. A great object is to have a wire<br>
whose resistance will be unaffected by heat.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Coils, Henry's.</span><br>
An apparatus used in repeating a classic experiment in electro-magnetic<br>
induction, due to Prof. Henry. It consists in a number of coils, the<br>
first and last ones single, the intermediate ones connected in pairs,<br>
and one of one pair placed on the top of one of the next pair. On<br>
opening or closing the circuit of an end coil the induced effect goes<br>
through the series and is felt in the circuit of the other end coil.<br>
Prof. Henry extended the series so as to include seven successive<br>
inductions, sometimes called inductions of the first, second, third and<br>
other orders. Frequently ribbon coils (see Coil, Ribbon,) are used in<br>
these experiments.<br>

A device for prolonging the range of magnetic attraction. It consists of<br>
a series of magnetizing coils traversed by an iron plunger. As it passes<br>
through them, the current is turned off the one in the rear or passing<br>
to the rear and turned into the next one in advance. The principle was<br>
utilized in one of Page's electric motors about 1850, and later by<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Collecting Ring.</span><br>
In some kinds of generators instead of the commutator a pair of<br>
collecting rings of metal, insulated from the machine and from each<br>
other, are carried on the armature shaft. A brush, q. v., presses on<br>
each, and the circuit terminals connect to these two brushes. Such rings<br>
are employed often on alternating current generators, where the current<br>
does not have to be changed or commuted. Collecting rings with their<br>
brushes are used also where a current has to be communicated to a<br>
revolving coil or circuit as in the magnetic car wheel, the cut of which<br>
is repeated here. The coil of wire surrounding the wheel and rotating<br>
with it has to receive current. This it receives through the two<br>
stationary brushes which press upon two insulated metallic rings,<br>
surrounding the shaft. The terminals of the coil connect one to each<br>
ring. Thus while the coil rotates it constantly receives current, the<br>
brushes being connected to the actuating circuit.<br>

<br>
<br>
141&nbsp; STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.<br>
<br>
<br>
As a part of electric motors and generators, its function is to collect<br>
the currents produced by the cutting of lines of force so as to cause<br>
them all to concur to a desired result. The cut shows the simplest form<br>
of commutator, one with but two divisions. Its object may be to enable a<br>
current of constant direction to be taken from a rotating armature, in<br>
which the currents alternate or change direction once in each rotation.<br>
It is carried by the shaft A of the armature and rotates with it. It<br>
consists of two leaves, S S, to which the terminals of the armature are<br>
connected. Two springs, W W, the terminals of the outer circuit, press<br>
against the leaves. The springs which do this take off the current. It<br>
is so placed, with reference to the springs and armature, that just as<br>
the current changes in direction, each leaf changes from one spring to<br>
the other. Thus the springs receive constant direction currents. The<br>
changing action of this commutator appears in its changing the character<br>
of the current from alternating to constant. Were two insulated<br>
collecting rings used instead of a commutator, the current in the outer<br>
circuit would be an alternating one. On some dynamos the commutator has<br>
a very large number of leaves.<br>
<br>
Taking the Gramme ring armature, there must be as many divisions of the<br>
commutator as there are connections to the coils. In this case the<br>
function of the commutator is simply to lessen friction, for the brushes<br>
could be made to take current from the coils directly outside of the<br>
periphery of the ring.<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Commutator, Split Ring.</span><br>
A two-division commutator for a motor; it consists of two segments of<br>
brass or copper plate, bent to arcs of a circle, and attached to an<br>
insulating cylinder. They are mounted on the revolving spindle, which<br>
carries the armature, and acts as a two part commutator. For an example<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Compass.</span><br>
An apparatus for utilizing the directive force of the earth upon the<br>
magnetic needle. It consists of a circular case, within which is poised<br>
a magnetized bar of steel. This points approximately to the north, and<br>
is used on ships and elsewhere to constantly show the direction of the<br>
magnetic meridian. Two general types are used. In one the needle is<br>
mounted above a fixed "card" or dial, on which degrees or points of the<br>
compass, q. v., are inscribed. In the other the card is attached to the<br>
needle and rotates with it. The latter represents especially the type<br>
known as the mariner's compass. (See Compass, Mariner's--Compass,<br>
Spirit, and other titles under compass, also Magnetic Axis--Magnetic<br>
Elements.) The needle in good compasses carries for a bearing at its<br>
centre, a little agate cup, and a sharp brass pin is the point of<br>
support.<br>

The card in a compass; it is circular in shape, and its centre coincides<br>
with the axis of rotation of the magnetic needle; on it are marked the<br>
points of the compass, at the ends generally of star points. (See<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Compass, Declination.</span><br>
An instrument by which the magnetic declination of any place may be<br>
determined. It is virtually a transit instrument and compass combined,<br>
the telescope surmounting the latter. In the instrument shown in the<br>
cut, L is a telescope mounted by its axis, X, in raised journals with<br>
vernier, K, and arc x, for reading its vertical angle, with level n. The<br>
azimuth circle, Q, R, is fixed. A vernier, V is carried by the box, A,<br>
E, and both turn with the telescope. A very light lozenge-shaped<br>
magnetic needle, a, b, is pivoted in the exact centre of the graduated<br>
circles, Q R, and M. The true meridian is determined by any convenient<br>
astronomical method, and the telescope is used for the purpose. The<br>
variation of the needle from the meridian thus determined gives the<br>

rotation of the card is exactly in a plane, passing through the keel of<br>
the ship. Thus however the ship may be going, the point of the card<br>
under or in line with the "lubber's mark," shows how the ship is<br>

A form of mariner's compass. The bowl or case is hermetically sealed and<br>
filled with alcohol or other nonfreezing liquid. The compass card is<br>
made with hollow compartments so as nearly to float. In this way the<br>
friction of the pivot or point of support is greatly diminished, and the<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Compensating Resistances.</span><br>
In using a galvanometer shunt the total resistance of the circuit is<br>
diminished so that in some cases too much current flows through it; in<br>
such case additional resistance, termed as above, is sometimes<br>
introduced in series. The shunt in parallel with the galvanometer is<br>
thus compensated for, and the experimental or trial circuit does not<br>
take too much current.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Complementary Distribution.</span><br>
Every distribution of electricity has somewhere a corresponding<br>
distribution, exactly equal to it of opposite electricity; the latter is<br>
the complimentary distribution to the first, and the first distribution<br>
is also complimentary to it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Component.</span><br>
A force may always be represented diagrammatically by a straight line,<br>
terminating in an arrow-head to indicate the direction, and of length to<br>
represent the intensity of the force. The line may always be assumed to<br>
represent the diagonal of a parallelogram, two of whose sides are<br>
represented by lines starting from the base of the arrow, and of length<br>
fixed by the condition that the original force shall be the diagonal of<br>
the parallelogram of which they are two contiguous sides; such lines are<br>
called components, and actually represent forces into which the original<br>
force may always be resolved. The components can have any direction.<br>
Thus the vertical component of a horizontal force is zero; its<br>
horizontal component is equal to itself. Its 450 component is equal to<br>
the square root of one-half of its square.<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Condenser.</span><br>
An appliance for storing up electrostatic charges: it is also called a<br>
static accumulator. The telegraphic condenser consists of a box packed<br>
full of sheets of tinfoil. Between every two sheets is a sheet of<br>
paraffined paper, or of mica. The alternate sheets of tinfoil are<br>
connected together, and each set has its own binding post. (See<br>
Accumulator, Electrostatic.)<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Condenser, Sliding.</span><br>
An apparatus representing a Leyden jar whose coatings can be slid past<br>
each other. This diminishes or increases the facing area, and<br>
consequently in almost exactly similar ratio diminishes or increases the<br>
capacity of the condenser.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Conductance.</span><br>
The conducting power of a given mass of specified material of specified<br>
shape and connections. Conductance varies in cylindrical or prismatic<br>
conductors, inversely as the length, directly as the cross-section, and<br>
with the conductivity of the material. Conductance is an attribute of<br>
any specified conductor, and refers to its shape, length and other<br>
factors. Conductivity is an attribute of any specified material without<br>
direct reference to its shape, or other factors.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Conduction.</span><br>

<br>
<br>
145&nbsp; STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Conductivity.</span><br>
The relative power of conducting the electric current possessed by<br>
different substances. A path for the current through the ether is opened<br>
by the presence of a body of proper quality, and this quality, probably<br>
correlated to opacity, is termed conductivity. There is no perfect<br>
conductor, all offer some resistance, q. v., and there is hardly any<br>
perfect non-conductor. It is the reverse and reciprocal of resistance.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Conductivity, Specific.</span><br>
The reciprocal of specific resistance. (See Resistance--Specific.)<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Conductivity, Unit of.</span><br>
The reciprocal of the ohm; it is a more logical unit, but has never been<br>
generally adopted; as a name the title mho (or ohm written backwards)<br>
has been suggested by Sir William Thomson, and provisionally adopted.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Conductivity, Variable.</span><br>
The conductivity for electric currents of conductors varies with their<br>
temperature, with varying magnetization, tension, torsion and<br>
compression.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Conductor.</span><br>
In electricity, anything that permits the passage of an electric<br>
current. Any disturbance in the ether takes the form of waves because<br>
the ether has restitutive force or elasticity. In a conductor, on the<br>
other hand, this force is wanting; it opens a path through the ether and<br>
a disturbance advances through it from end to end with a wave front, but<br>
with no succession of waves. This advance is the beginning of what is<br>
termed a current. It is, by some theorists, attributed to impulses given<br>
at all points along the conductor through the surrounding ether, so that<br>
a current is not merely due to an end thrust. If ether waves preclude a<br>
current on account of their restitutive force, ether waves cannot be<br>
maintained in a conductor, hence conductors should be opaque to light,<br>
for the latter is due to ether waves. This is one of the more practical<br>
every day facts brought out in Clerk Maxwell's electromagnetic theory of<br>
light. The term conductor is a relative one, as except a vacuum there is<br>
probably no substance that has not some conducting power. For relative<br>
conducting power, tables of conductivity, q. v., should be consulted.<br>
The metals beginning with silver are the best conductors, glass is one<br>
of the worst.<br>

discarded concept.]<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Conductor, Anti-Induction.</span><br>
A current conductor arranged to avoid induction from other lines. Many<br>
kinds have been invented and made the subject of patents. A fair<br>
approximation may be attained by using a through metallic circuit and<br>
twisting the wires composing it around each other. Sometimes concentric<br>
conductors, one a wire and the other a tube, are used, insulated, one<br>
acting as return circuit for the other.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Conductor, Prime.</span><br>
A body often cylindrical or spherical in shape, in any case with no<br>
points or angles, but rounded everywhere, whose surface, if the<br>
conductor itself is not metallic, is made conducting by tinfoil or gold<br>
leaf pasted over it. It is supported on an insulating stand and is used<br>
to collect or receive and retain static charges of electricity.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Conductors, Equivalent.</span><br>
Conductors of identical resistance. The quotient of the length divided<br>
by the product of the conductivity and cross-section must be the same in<br>
each, if each is of uniform diameter.<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Conjugate. adj.</span><br>
Conjugate coils or conductors are coils placed in such relation that the<br>
lines of force established by one do not pass through the coils of the<br>
other. Hence variations of current in one produce no induced currents in<br>
the other.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Connect. v.</span><br>
To bring two ends of a conductor together, or to bring one end of a<br>
conductor in connection with another, or in any way to bring about an<br>
electrical connection.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Connector.</span><br>
A sleeve with screws or other equivalent device for securing the ends of<br>
wires in electrical contact. A binding-post, q. v., is an example.<br>
Sometimes wire spring-catches are used, the general idea being a device<br>
that enables wires to be connected or released at will without breaking<br>
off or marring their ends. The latter troubles result from twisting<br>
wires together.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Consequent Poles.</span><br>
A bar magnet is often purposely or accidentally magnetized so as to have<br>
both ends of the same polarity, and the center of opposite polarity. The<br>
center is said to comprise two consequent poles. (See Magnet,<br>
Anomalous.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Conservation of Electricity.</span><br>
As every charge of electricity has its equal and opposite charge<br>
somewhere, near or far, more or less distributed, the sum of negative is<br>
equal always to the sum of positive electrical charges. For this<br>
doctrine the above title was proposed by Lippman.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Contact Breaker.</span><br>
Any contrivance for closing a circuit, and generally for opening and<br>
closing in quick succession. An old and primitive form consisted of a<br>
very coarsely cut file. This was connected to one terminal, and the<br>
other terminal was drawn over its face, making and breaking contact as<br>
it jumped from tooth to tooth. (See Circuit Breaker--do. Automatic,<br>

A contact between two conductors, such that a current can flow through<br>

When two dissimilar substances are touched they assume different<br>
electric potentials. If conductors, their entire surfaces are affected;<br>
if dielectrics, only the surfaces which touch each other. (See Contact<br>
Theory.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Contact Faults.</span><br>
A class of faults often called contacts, due to contact of the conductor<br>
of a circuit with another conductor. A full or metallic contact is where<br>
practically perfect contact is established; a partial contact and<br>
intermittent contact are self-explanatory.<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Contact Point.</span><br>
A point, pin or stud, often of platinum, arranged to come in contact<br>
with a contact spring, q. v., or another contact point or surface, under<br>
any determined conditions.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Contact Potential Difference.</span><br>
The potential difference established by the contact of two dissimilar<br>
substances according to the contact theory, q. v.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Contact Series.</span><br>
An arrangement or tabulation of substances in pairs, each intermediate<br>
substance appearing in two pairs, as the last member of the first, and<br>
first member of the succeeding pair, with the statement of the potential<br>
difference due to their contact, the positively electrified substance<br>
coming first. The following table of some contact potentials is due to<br>

The sum of these differences is 1.089, which is the contact potential<br>
between zinc and carbon.<br>
<br>
Volta's Law refers to this and states that--<br>
&nbsp; The difference of potential produced by the contact of any two<br>
&nbsp; substances is equal to the sum of the differences of potentials<br>
&nbsp; between the intervening substances in the contact series.<br>
<br>
It is to be remarked that the law should no longer be restricted to or<br>
stated only for metals.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Contact-spring.</span><br>
A spring connected to one lead of an electric circuit, arranged to press<br>
against another spring, or contact point, q. v., under any conditions<br>
determined by the construction of the apparatus. (See Bell,<br>
Electric--Coil, Induction.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Contact Theory.</span><br>
A theory devised to explain electrification, the charging of bodies by<br>
friction, or rubbing, and the production of current by the voltaic<br>
battery. It holds that two bodies, by mere contact become oppositely<br>
electrified. If such contact is increased in extent by rubbing together,<br>
the intensity of their electrification is increased. This<br>
electrification is accounted for by the assumption of different kinetic<br>
energy, or energy of molecular motion, possessed by the two bodies;<br>
there being a loss and gain of energy, on the two sides respectively,<br>
the opposite electrifications are the result. Then when separated, the<br>
two bodies come apart oppositely electrified.<br>
<br>
The above accounts for the frictional production of electricity. In the<br>
voltaic battery, a separation of the atoms of hydrogen and oxygen, and<br>
their consolidation into molecules occurs, and to such separation and<br>
the opposite electrification of the electrodes by the oxygen and<br>
hydrogen, the current is attributed, because the hydrogen goes to one<br>
electrode, and the oxygen to the other, each giving up or sharing its<br>
own charge with the electrodes to which it goes. If zinc is touched to<br>
copper, the zinc is positively and the copper negatively electrified. In<br>
the separation of hydrogen and oxygen, the hydrogen is positively and<br>
the oxygen negatively electrified. In the battery, the current is due to<br>
the higher contact difference of oxygen and hydrogen compared to that<br>
between zinc and copper. It will be seen that the two contact actions in<br>
a battery work against each other, and that the current is due to a<br>
differential contact action. The zinc in a battery is electrified<br>
negatively because the negative electrification of the oxygen is greater<br>
in amount than its own positive electrification due to contact with the<br>
copper.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Controlling Field.</span><br>
The magnetic or electro-magnetic field, which is used in galvanometers<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Convection, Electric.</span><br>
The production of blasts or currents of air (convection streams) from<br>
points connected to statically charged conductors. The term is sometimes<br>
applied to electric convection of heat. (See Convection of Heat,<br>
Electric.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Convection, Electrolytic.</span><br>
The resistance of acidulated water as a true conductor is known to be<br>
very, almost immeasurably, high. As an electrolytic, its resistance is<br>
very much lower. Hence the current produced between immersed electrodes<br>
is theoretically almost null, unless the difference of potential between<br>
them is high enough to decompose the liquid. Yet a feeble current too<br>
great for a true conduction current is sometimes observed when two<br>
electrodes with potential difference too low to cause decomposition are<br>
immersed in it. Such a current is termed an electrolytic convection<br>
current. It is supposed to be due to various causes. Some attribute it<br>
to the presence of free oxygen from the air, dissolved in the water with<br>
which the hydrogen combines. Others attribute it to the diffusion of the<br>
gases of decomposition in the solution; others assume a partial<br>
polarization of the molecules without decomposition. Other theories are<br>
given, all of which are unsatisfactory. The term is due to Helmholtz.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Convection of Heat, Electric.</span><br>
The effect of a current upon the distribution of heat in an unevenly<br>
heated conductor. In some, such as copper, the current tends to equalize<br>
the varying temperatures; the convection is then said to be positive, as<br>
comparable to that of water flowing through an unequally heated tube. In<br>
others, such as platinum or iron, it is negative, making the heated<br>
parts hotter, and the cooler parts relatively cooler.<br>
<br>
The effect of the electric current in affecting the distribution of heat<br>
in unequally heated metal (Thomson's effect. q. v.), is sometimes so<br>
termed. If a current passes through unequally heated iron it tends to<br>
increase the difference of temperature, and the convection is negative;<br>
in copper it tends to equalize the temperature, and the convection is<br>
positive.<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Converter.</span><br>
An induction coil used with the alternating current for changing<br>
potential difference and inversely therewith the available current. They<br>
generally lower the potential, and increase the current, and are placed<br>
between the primary high potential system that connects the houses with<br>
the central station, and the secondary low potential system within the<br>
houses. A converter consists of a core of thin iron sheets, wound with a<br>
fine primary coil of many convolutions, and a coarse secondary coil of<br>
few convolutions. The ratio of convolutions gives the ratio of maximum<br>
potential differences of their terminals between the primary and<br>
secondary coils. The coil may be jacketed with iron to increase the<br>
permeance. (See Alternating Current System.)<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Co-ordinates, System of.</span><br>
A system for indicating the position of points in space by reference to<br>
fixed lines, intersecting at a determined and arbitrary point 0, termed<br>
the origin of co-ordinates. In plane rectangular co-ordinates two lines<br>
are drawn through the origin, one horizontal, termed the axis of<br>
abscissas, or axis of X. All distances measured parallel to it, if<br>
unknown, are indicated by x, and are termed abscissas. The other axis is<br>
vertical, and is termed the axis of ordinates, or axis of Y. All<br>
distances measured parallel to it, if unknown, are indicated by y and<br>
are termed ordinates. Thus by naming its abscissa and ordinate a point<br>
has its position with reference to the axes determined, and by<br>
indicating the relation between a point, line or curve, and a system of<br>
abscissas and ordinates, the properties of a line or curve can be<br>
expressed algebraically. Co-ordinates may also be inclined to each other<br>
at any other angles, forming oblique co-ordinates; relations may be<br>
expressed partly in angles referred to the origin as a centre, giving<br>
polar co-ordinates. For solid geometry or calculations in three<br>
dimensions, a third axis, or axis of Z, is used, distances parallel to<br>
which if unknown are indicated by z.<br>

A solution of copper used for depositing the metal in the electroplating<br>

sulphate solution, special baths have to be used.<br>
<br>
The regular bath for copper plating is the following:<br>
<br>
To water acidulated with 8 to 10 percent. of sulphuric acid as much<br>
copper sulphate is added as it will take up at the ordinary temperature.<br>
The saturated bath should have a density of 1.21. It is used cold and is<br>
kept in condition by the use of copper anodes, or fresh crystals may be<br>
added from time to time.<br>

oxidation of the plates alone is relied on. The plates, in general, are<br>
laid perpendicular to the principal convolutions of the wire, or<br>

such currents are induced by the variation in intensity of the field of<br>
force, and their direction is perpendicular to the lines of force, or<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Core, Tubular.</span><br>
Tubes used as cores for electro-magnets. For very small magnetizing<br>
power, tubular cores are nearly as efficient as solid ones in straight<br>
magnets, because the principal reluctance is due to the air-path. On<br>
increasing the magnetization the tubular core becomes less efficient<br>
than the solid core, as the reluctance of the air-path becomes<br>
proportionately of less importance in the circuit.<br>

the C. G. S. electro-magnetic unit of quantity, and to 3,000,000,000 C.<br>
G. S. electrostatic units of quantity. It corresponds to the<br>
decomposition of .0935 milligrams of water, or to the deposition of<br>
1.11815 milligrams of silver.<br>

the revolutions of shafts, or any other data or factors.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Counter-electro-motive Force.</span><br>
A potential difference in a circuit opposed to the main potential<br>
difference, and hence, resisting the operation of the latter, and<br>
diminishing the current which would be produced without it. It appears<br>
in electric motors, which, to a certain extent, operate as dynamos and<br>
reduce the effective electro-motive force that operates them. It<br>
appears in the primary coils of induction coils, and when the secondary<br>
circuit is open, is almost equal to the main electro-motive force, so<br>
that hardly any current can go through them under such conditions. It<br>
appears in galvanic batteries, when hydrogen accumulates on the copper<br>
plate, and in other chemical reactions. A secondary battery is charged<br>
by a current in the reverse direction to that which it would normally<br>
produce. Its own potential difference then appears as a<br>
counter-electro-motive force.<br>
<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Counter-electro-motive Force of
Polarization.</span><br>
To decompose a solution by electrolysis, enough electro-motive force is<br>
required to overcome the energy of composition of the molecule<br>
decomposed. A part of this takes the form of a counter-electromotive<br>
force, one which, for a greater or less time would maintain a current in<br>
the opposite direction if the original source of current were removed.<br>
Thus in the decomposition of water, the electrodes become covered, one<br>
with bubbles of oxygen, the others with bubbles of hydrogen; this<br>
creates a counter E. M. F. of polarization. In a secondary battery, the<br>
working current may be defined as due to this cause.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Creeping.</span><br>
A phenomenon of capillarity, often annoying in battery jars. The<br>
solution, by capillarity, rises a little distance up the sides,<br>
evaporates, and as it dries more creeps up through it, and to a point a<br>
little above it. This action is repeated until a layer of the salts may<br>
form over the top of the vessel. To avoid it, paraffine is often applied<br>
to the edges of the cup, or a layer of oil, often linseed oil, is poured<br>
on the battery solution,<br>

The weight of a litre of hydrogen at 0&ordm; C. (32&ordm; F.), and 760
mm. (30<br>
inches) barometric pressure. It is .0896 grams. The molecular weight of<br>
any gas divided by 2 and multiplied by the value of the crith, gives the<br>
weight of a litre of the gas in question. Thus a litre of electrolytic<br>
gas, a mixture of two molecules of hydrogen for one of oxygen, with a<br>
mean molecular weight of 12, weighs (12/2) * .0896 or .5376 gram.<br>

the other wire if necessary.<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Cross-magnetizing Effect.</span><br>
A phase of armature interference. The current in an armature of a dynamo<br>
or motor is such as to develop lines of force approximately at right<br>
angles to those of the field. The net cross-magnetizing effect is such<br>
component of these lines, as is at right angles to the lines produced by<br>
the field alone.<br>

Many substances under proper conditions take a crystalline form. The<br>
great condition is the passage from the fluid into the solid state. When<br>

nitrate for instance, decomposed by a current, may give crystals of<br>
metallic silver.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Cup, Porous.</span><br>
A cup used in two-fluid voltaic batteries to keep the solutions separate<br>
to some extent. It forms a diaphragm through which diffusion inevitably<br>
takes place, but which is considerably retarded, while electrolysis and<br>
electrolytic convection take place freely through its walls. As<br>
material, unglazed pottery is very generally used.<br>
<br>
In some batteries the cup is merely a receptacle for the solid<br>
depolarizer. Thus, in the Leclanch&eacute; battery, the cup contains the<br>
manganese dioxide and graphite in which the carbon electrode is<br>
embedded, but does not separate two solutions, as the battery only uses<br>
one. Nevertheless, the composition of the solution outside and inside<br>
may vary, but such variation is incidental only, and not an essential of<br>
the operation.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Current.</span><br>
The adjustment, or effects of a continuous attempt at readjustment of<br>
potential difference by a conductor, q. v., connecting two points of<br>
different potential. A charged particle or body placed in a field of<br>
force tends to move toward the oppositely charged end or portion of the<br>
field. If a series of conducting particles or a conducting body are held<br>
so as to be unable to move, then the charge of the field tends, as it<br>
were, to move through it, and a current results. It is really a<br>
redistribution of the field and as long as such redistribution continues<br>
a current exists. A current is assumed to flow from a positive to a<br>
negative terminal; as in the case of a battery, the current in the outer<br>
circuit is assumed to flow from the carbon to the zinc plate, and in the<br>
solution to continue from zinc to carbon. As a memoria technica the zinc<br>
may be thought of as generating the current delivering it through the<br>
solution to the carbon, whence it flows through the wire connecting<br>
them. (See Ohm's Law--Maxwell's Theory of Light--Conductor-Intensity.)<br>
<br>
[Transcriber's note: Supposing electric current to be the motion of <br>
positive charge causes no practical difficulty, but the current is <br>
actually the (slight) motion of negative electrons.]<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Current, After.</span><br>
A current produced by the animal tissue after it has been subjected to a<br>
current in the opposite direction for some time. The tissue acts like a<br>
secondary battery. The term is used in electro-therapeutics.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Current, Alternating.</span><br>
Usually defined and spoken of as a current flowing alternately in<br>
opposite directions. It may be considered as a succession of currents,<br>
each of short duration and of direction opposite to that of its<br>
predecessor. It is graphically represented by such a curve as shown in<br>
the cut. The horizontal line may denote a zero current, that is no<br>
current at all, or may be taken to indicate zero electro-motive force.<br>
The curve represents the current, or the corresponding electro-motive<br>
forces. The further from the horizontal line the greater is either, and<br>
if above the line the direction is opposite to that corresponding to the<br>
positions below the line. Thus the current is alternately in opposite<br>
directions, has periods of maximum intensity, first in one and then in<br>
the opposite sense, and between these, passing from one direction to the<br>
other, is of zero intensity. It is obvious that the current may rise<br>
quickly in intensity and fall slowly, or the reverse, or may rise and<br>
fall irregularly. All such phases may be shown by the curve, and a curve<br>
drawn to correctly represent these variations is called the<br>
characteristic curve of such current. It is immaterial whether the<br>
ordinates of the curve be taken as representing current strength or<br>
electromotive force. If interpreted as representing electro-motive<br>
force, the usual interpretation and best, the ordinates above the line<br>
are taken as positive and those below as negative.<br>

The assumed direction of a current is from positively charged electrode<br>

copper plate through the outer circuit to the zinc plate and back<br>
through the electrolyte to the carbon or copper plate. (See Current.)<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Current, Extra.</span><br>
When a circuit is suddenly opened or closed a current of very brief<br>
duration, in the first case in the same direction, in the other case in<br>
the opposite direction, is produced, which exceeds the ordinary current<br>
in intensity. A high potential difference is produced for an instant<br>
only. These are called extra currents. As they are produced by<br>
electro-magnetic induction, anything which strengthens the field of<br>
force increases the potential difference to which they are due. Thus the<br>
wire may be wound in a coil around an iron core, in which case the extra<br>
currents may be very strong. (See Induction, Self-Coil, Spark.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Current, Faradic.</span><br>

<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Current, Foucault.</span><br>
A current produced in solid conductors, and which is converted into heat<br>
(Ganot). These currents are produced by moving the conductors through a<br>
field, or by altering the strength of a field in which they are<br>
contained. They are the source of much loss of energy and other<br>
derangement in dynamos and motors, and to avoid them the armature cores<br>
are laminated, the plane of the laminations being parallel to the lines<br>
of force. (See Core, Laminated.)<br>
<br>
The presence of Foucault currents, if of long duration, is shown by the<br>
heating of the metal in which they are produced. In dynamo armatures<br>
they are produced sometimes in the metal of the windings, especially if<br>
the latter are of large diameter.<br>

strength. It is opposite in direction to the inducing current and hence<br>
is termed inverse. (See Induction, Electro-magnetic.) The parallel<br>
conductors may be in one circuit or in two separate circuits.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Current, Make and Break.</span><br>
A succession of currents of short duration, separated by absolute<br>
cessation of current. Such current is produced by a telegraph key, or by<br>
a microphone badly adjusted, so that the circuit is broken at intervals.<br>
The U. S. Courts have virtually decided that the telephone operates by<br>
the undulatory currents, and not by a make and break current. Many<br>
attempts have been made to produce a telephone operating by a<br>
demonstrable make and break current, on account of the above<br>
distinction, in hopes of producing a telephone outside of the scope of<br>
the Bell telephone patent.<br>

such net voltage.<br>

A divided or branch current. A current which goes through a single<br>

The currents of electricity assumed by Ampere's theory to circulate<br>
around a magnet. As they represent the maintenance of a current or of<br>
currents without the expenditure of energy they are often assumed to be<br>
of molecular dimensions. As they all go in the same sense of rotation<br>
and are parallel to each other the result is the same as if a single set<br>
of currents circulated around the body of the magnet. More will be found<br>
on this subject under Magnetism. The Amp&eacute;rian currents are purely<br>
hypothetical and are predicated on the existence of a field of force<br>
about a permanent magnet. (See Magnetism, Amp&eacute;re's Theory of.)<br>
<br>
If the observer faces the north pole of a magnet the Amp&eacute;rian
currents<br>
are assumed to go in the direction opposite to that of a watch, and the<br>
reverse for the south pole.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Currents, Earth.</span><br>
In long telegraph lines having terminal grounds or connected to earth<br>
only at their ends, potential differences are sometimes observed that<br>
are sufficient to interfere with their working and which, of course, can<br>
produce currents. These are termed earth-currents. It will be noted that<br>
they exist in the wire, not in the earth. They may be of 40 milliamperes<br>
strength, quite enough to work a telegraph line without any battery.<br>
Lines running N. E. and S. W. are most affected; those running N.W. and<br>
S. E. very much less so. These currents only exist in lines grounded at<br>
both ends, and appear in underground wires. Hence they are not<br>
attributable to atmospheric electricity. According to Wilde they are the<br>
primary cause of magnetic storms, q. v., but not of the periodical<br>
changes in the magnetic elements. (See Magnetic Elements.)<br>

(a) If two terminals of an active circuit are connected to two points of<br>

considerable area of such plate, and this portion of the current is a<br>
current sheet.<br>
<br>
The general contour of the current sheet can be laid out in lines of<br>
flux. Such lines resemble lines of force. Like the latter, they are<br>
purely an assumption, as the current is not in any sense composed&nbsp;
of<br>
lines.<br>

in phase are collected from corresponding contact rings. There are<br>
virtually as many windings on the armature as there are currents to be<br>
produced. Separate conductors for the currents must be used throughout.<br>

An intermittent current passing through a conductor will induce<br>

secondary current will induce a tertiary current in a third closed<br>
circuit near it, and so on. The induced currents are termed as of the<br>

melting ice and condensing steam, so that an identical current can be<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Current, Undulatory.</span><br>
A current varying in strength without any abrupt transition from action<br>
to inaction, as in the make and break current. The current may be<br>
continually changing in direction (see Current, Alternating), and hence,<br>
of necessity, may pass through stages of zero intensity, but such<br>
transition must be by a graduation, not by an abrupt transition. Such<br>
current may be represented by a curve, such as the curve of sines. It is<br>
evident that the current may pass through the zero point as it crosses<br>
the line or changes direction without being a make and break current.<br>
When such a current does alternate in direction it is sometimes called a<br>
"shuttle current." The ordinary commercial telephone current and the<br>
alternating current is of this type. (See Current, Make and Break.)<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Current, Wattless.</span><br>
Whenever there is a great difference in phase in an alternating current<br>
dynamo between volts and current, the true watts are much less than the<br>
product of the virtual volts and amperes, because the the watts are<br>
obtained by multiplying the product of the virtual volts and amperes by<br>
the cosine of the angle of lag (or lead). Any alternating current may be<br>
resolved into two components in quadrature with each other, one in phase<br>
with the volts, the other in quadrature therewith, the former is termed<br>
by S. P. Thompson the Working Current, the latter the Wattless Current.<br>
The greater the angle of lag the greater will be the wattless current.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Curve, Arrival.</span><br>
A curve representing the rate of rise of intensity of current at the end<br>
of a long conductor when the circuit has been closed at the other end.<br>
In the Atlantic cable, for instance, it would require about 108 seconds<br>
for the current at the distant end to attain 9/10 of its full value. The<br>
curve is drawn with its abscissa representing time and its ordinates<br>
current strength.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Curve, Characteristic.</span><br>
A curve indicating, graphically, the relations between any two factors,<br>
which are interdependent, or which vary simultaneously. Thus in a<br>
dynamo, the voltage increases with the speed of rotation, and a<br>
characteristic curve may be based on the relations between the speed of<br>
rotation and voltage developed. The current produced by a dynamo varies<br>
with the electro-motive force, and a curve can express the relations<br>
between the electro-motive force and the current produced.<br>
<br>
A characteristic curve is usually laid out by rectangular co-ordinates<br>
(see Co-ordinates). Two lines are drawn at right angles to each other,<br>
one vertical, and the other horizontal. One set of data are marked off<br>
on the horizontal line, say one ampere, two amperes, and so on, in the<br>
case of a dynamo's characteristic curve.<br>
<br>
For each amperage of current there is a corresponding voltage in the<br>
circuit. Therefore on each ampere mark a vertical is erected, and on<br>
that the voltage corresponding to such amperage is laid off. This gives<br>
a series of points, and these points may be connected by a curve. Such<br>
curve will be a characteristic curve.<br>
<br>
The more usual way of laying out a curve is to work directly upon the<br>
two axes. On one is laid off the series of values of one set of data; on<br>
the other the corresponding series of values of the other dependent<br>
data. Vertical lines or ordinates, q. v., are erected on the horizontal<br>
line or axis of abscissas at the points laid off; horizontal lines or<br>
abscissas, q. v., are drawn from the points laid off on the vertical<br>
line or axis of ordinates. The characteristic curve is determined by the<br>
intersections of each corresponding pair of abscissa and ordinate.<br>
<br>
<br>
169&nbsp; STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.<br>
<br>
<br>
Variations exist in characteristic curve methods. Thus to get the<br>
characteristic of a commutator, radial lines may be drawn from a circle<br>
representing its perimeter. Such lines may be of length proportional to<br>
the voltage developed on the commutator at the points whence the lines<br>
start. A cut giving an example of such a curve is given in Fig. 125.<br>
(See Curve of Distribution of Potential in Armature.)<br>
<br>
There is nothing absolute in the use of ordinates or abscissas. They may<br>
be interchanged. Ordinarily voltages are laid off as ordinates, but the<br>
practise may be reversed. The same liberty holds good for all<br>
characteristic curves. Custom, however, should be followed.<br>

A characteristic curve of a dynamo. It expresses the relation between<br>

is driven with different resistances in the external circuit and the<br>
current is measured for each resistance. This gives the amperes. The<br>
total resistance of the circuit, including that of the dynamo, is known.<br>
By Ohm's Law the electro-motive force in volts is obtained for each case<br>
by multiplying the total resistance of the circuit in ohms by the<br>
amperes of current forced through such resistance. Taking the voltages<br>
thus calculated for ordinates and the corresponding amperages for<br>
abscissas the curve is plotted. An example is shown in the cut.<br>

A characteristic curve of a dynamo, corresponding to the electro-motive<br>
force curve, except that the ordinates represent the voltages of the<br>

the machine, instead of the total electro-motive force of the circuit.<br>
The dynamo is run at constant speed. The resistance of the external<br>
circuit is varied. The voltages at the terminals of the machine and the<br>
amperages of current corresponding thereto are determined. Using the<br>
voltages thus determined as ordinates and the corresponding amperages as<br>
abscissas the external characteristic curve is plotted.<br>
<br>
This curve can be mechanically produced. A pencil may be moved against a<br>
constant force by two electro-magnets pulling at right angles to each<br>
other. One must be excited by the main current of the machine, the other<br>
by a shunt current from the terminals of the machine. The point of the<br>

A characteristic curve indicating the distribution of potential<br>

taken by a volt-meter or potential galvanometer, connection with the<br>
armature being made by two small metal brushes, held at a distance apart<br>
equal to the distance from centre to centre of two adjoining commutator<br>

the cross-section of the commutator, with the distances from the<br>
commutator surface to the curve proportional to the potential<br>
differences as determined by shifting the pair of brushes all around the<br>

An undulating curve representing wave motion. It is produced by<br>

the expiration of each one of the given intervals of time. The abscissas<br>
are proportional to the times and the ordinates to the sines of angles<br>
proportional to the times. Thus if a circle be drawn upon the line and<br>
divided into thirty-two parts of equal angular value, the sines of these<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Cut Out, Automatic.</span><br>
(a) A mechanism for automatically shunting an arc or other lamp when it<br>
ceases to work properly. It is generally worked by an electro-magnet of<br>
high resistance placed in parallel with the arc. If the arc grows too<br>
long the magnet attracts its armature, thereby completing a shunt of<br>
approximately the resistance of the arc, and which replaces it until the<br>
carbons approach again to within a proper distance. Sometimes a strip or<br>
wire of fusible metal is arranged in shunt with the arc. When the arc<br>
lengthens the current through the wire increases, melts it and a spring<br>
is released which acts to complete or close a shunt circuit of<br>
approximately arc-resistance.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Damper.</span><br>
(a) A copper frame on which the wire in a galvanometer is sometimes<br>
coiled, which acts to damp the oscillations of the needle.<br>
<br>
(b) A tube of brass or copper placed between the primary and secondary<br>
coils of an induction coil. It cuts off induction and diminishes the<br>
current and potential of the secondary circuit. On pulling it out, the<br>
latter increases. It is used on medical coils to adjust their strength<br>
of action.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Damping.</span><br>
Preventing the indicator of an instrument from oscillating in virtue of<br>
its own inertia or elasticity. In a galvanometer it is defined as<br>
resistance to quick vibrations of the needle, in consequence of which it<br>
is rapidly brought to rest when deflected (Ayrton). In dead-beat<br>
galvanometers (see Galvanometer, Dead-Beat,) damping is desirable in<br>
order to bring the needle to rest quickly; in ballistic galvanometers<br>
(see Galvanometer, Ballistic,) damping is avoided in order to maintain<br>
the principle of the instrument. Damping may be mechanical, the<br>
frictional resistance of air to an air-vane, or of a liquid to an<br>
immersed diaphragm or loosely fitting piston, being employed. A<br>
dash-pot, q. v., is an example of the latter. It may be<br>
electro-magnetic. A mass of metal near a swinging magnetic needle tends<br>
by induced currents to arrest the oscillations thereof, and is used for<br>
this purpose in dead-beat galvanometers. This is termed, sometimes,<br>
magnetic friction. The essence of damping is to develop resistance to<br>
movement in some ratio proportional to velocity, so that no resistance<br>
is offered to the indicator slowly taking its true position. (See<br>
Galvanometer, Dead-Beat.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Dash-Pot.</span><br>
A cylinder and piston, the latter loosely fitting or perforated, or some<br>
equivalent means being provided to permit movement. The cylinder may<br>
contain a liquid such as glycerine, or air only. Thus the piston is<br>
perfectly free to move, but any oscillations are damped (see Damping).<br>
In some arc lamps the carbon holder is connected to a dash-pot to check<br>
too sudden movements of the carbon. The attachment may be either to the<br>
piston or to the cylinder. In the Brush lamp the top of the carbon<br>
holder forms a cylinder containing glycerine, and in it a loosely<br>
fitting piston works. This acts as a dash-pot.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Dead Beat. adj.</span><br>
Reaching its reading quickly; applied to instruments having a moving<br>
indicator, which normally would oscillate back and forth a number of<br>
times before reaching its reading were it not prevented by damping. (See<br>

In the winding of an armature, a given percentage of the turns, it may<br>
be 80 per cent., more or less, is assumed to be active; the other 20 per<br>
cent. or thereabouts, is called dead-turns. This portion represents the<br>
wire on such portions of the armature as comes virtually outside of the<br>
magnetic field. They are termed dead, as not concurring to the<br>
production of electro-motive force.<br>
<br>
<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Death, Electrical.</span><br>
Death resulting from electricity discharged through the animal system.<br>
The exact conditions requisite for fatal results have not been<br>
determined. High electro-motive force is absolutely essential; a<br>
changing current, pulsatory or alternating, is most fatal, possibly<br>
because of the high electro-motive force of a portion of each period.<br>
Amperage probably has something to do with it, although the total<br>
quantity in coulombs may be very small. As applied to the execution of<br>
criminals, the victim is seated in a chair and strapped thereto. One<br>
electrode with wet padded surface is placed against his head or some<br>
adjacent part. Another electrode is placed against some of the lower<br>
parts, and a current from an alternating dynamo passed for 15 seconds or<br>
more. The potential difference of the electrodes is given at 1,500 to<br>
2,000 volts, but of course the maximum may be two or three times the<br>

conditions are established which make the index point to zero and from<br>
the conditions necessary for this the measurement is deduced. The<br>
Wheatstone Bridge, q. v., illustrates a zero method, the sine or the<br>
tangent compass, illustrates a deflection method. The use of deflection<br>
methods involves calibration, q. v., and the commercial measuring<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Demagnetization.</span><br>
Removal of magnetism from a paramagnetic substance. It is principally<br>
used for watches which have become magnetized by exposure to the<br>
magnetic field surrounding dynamos or motors.<br>
<br>
The general principles of most methods are to rotate the object, as a<br>
watch, in a strong field, and while it is rotating to gradually remove<br>
it from the field, or to gradually reduce the intensity of the field<br>
itself to zero. A conical coil of wire within which the field is<br>
produced in which the watch is placed is sometimes used, the idea being<br>
that the field within such a coil is strongest at its base. Such a coil<br>
supplied by an alternating current is found effectual (J. J. Wright).<br>
<br>
If a magnetized watch is made to turn rapidly at the end of a twisted<br>
string and is gradually brought near to and withdrawn from the poles of<br>
a powerful dynamo it may be considerably improved.<br>
<br>
A hollow coil of wire connected with a pole changer and dip-battery has<br>
been used. The battery creates a strong field within the coil. The watch<br>
is placed there and the pole changer is worked so as to reverse the<br>
polarity of the field very frequently. By the same action of the pole<br>
changer the plates of the battery are gradually withdrawn from the<br>
solution so as to gradually reduce the magnetic field to zero while<br>
constantly reversing its polarity. (G. M. Hopkins.)<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Diamagnetic. adj.</span><br>
Possessing a negative coefficient of magnetic susceptibility; having<br>
permeability inferior to that of air. Such substances placed between the<br>
poles of a magnet are repelled; if in the form of bars, they tend to<br>
turn so as to have their long axis at right angles to the line joining<br>
the poles. The reason is that the lines of force always seek the easiest<br>
path, and these bodies having higher reluctance than air, impede the<br>
lines of force, and hence are as far as possible pushed out of the way.<br>
The above is the simplest explanation of a not well understood set of<br>
phenomena. According to Tyndall, "the diamagnetic force is a polar<br>
force, the polarity of diamagnetic bodies being opposed to that of<br>
paramagnetic ones under the same conditions of excitement." Bismuth is<br>
the most strongly diamagnetic body known; phosphorus, antimony, zinc,<br>
and many others are diamagnetic. (See Paramagnetic.)<br>

The points on the commutator of a closed circuit ring--or<br>
drum--armature, which the brushes touch, and whence they take the<br>
current, mark the extremities of the diameter of commutation. Were it<br>
not for the lag this would be the diameter at right angles to the line<br>
connecting the centers of the opposite faces of the field. It is always<br>
a little to one side of this position, being displaced in the direction<br>
of rotation. In open circuit armatures the brushes are placed on the<br>
diameter at right angles to this one, and sometimes the term diameter of<br>
commutation is applied to it. All that has been said is on the<br>
supposition that the armature divisions correspond not only in<br>
connection but in position with those of the armature coils. Of course,<br>
the commutator could be twisted so as to bring the diameter of<br>
commutation into any position desired.<br>

which appears in the discharge. The amount of energy is proportional to<br>
the charge, and to the potential difference. As any electrified body<br>
implies an opposite electrification somewhere, and a separating<br>
dielectric, the existence of a condenser is always implied.<br>
<br>
[Transcriber's note: The energy stored in a capacitor (condenser) is<br>
(Q*Q)/2C = (Q*V)/2 = (C*V*V)/2<br>
The energy is proportional to the voltage SQUARED or the charge
SQUARED.]<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Dielectric Polarization.</span><br>
A term due to Faraday. It expresses what he conceived to be the<br>
condition of a dielectric when its opposite faces are oppositely<br>
electrified. The molecules are supposed to be arranged by the<br>
electrification in a series of polar chains, possibly being originally<br>
in themselves seats of opposite polarities, or having such imparted to<br>
them by the electricities. The action is analogous to that of a magnet<br>
pole on a mass of soft iron, or on a pile of iron filings.<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Dielectric Strain.</span><br>
The strain a solid dielectric is subjected to, when its opposite<br>
surfaces are electrified. A Leyden jar dilates under the strain, and<br>
when discharged gives a dull sound. The original condition is not<br>
immediately recovered. Jarring, shaking, etc., assist the recovery from<br>
strain. The cause of the strain is termed Electric Stress. (See Stress,<br>
Electric.) This is identical with the phenomenon of residual charge.<br>
(See Charge, Residual.) Each loss of charge is accompanied with a<br>
proportional return of the dielectric towards its normal condition.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Dielectric Resistance.</span><br>
The mechanical resistance a body offers to perforation or destruction by<br>
the electric discharge.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Dielectric Strength.</span><br>
The resistance to the disruptive discharge and depending on its<br>
mechanical resistance largely or entirely. It is expressible in volts<br>
per centimeter thickness. Dry air requires 40,000 volts per centimeter<br>
for a discharge.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Differential Winding Working.</span><br>
A method of working an electro-magnet intermittently, so as to avoid<br>
sparking. The magnet is wound with two coils. One is connected straight<br>
into the circuit, the other is connected in parallel therewith with a<br>
switch inserted. The coils are so connected that when the switch is<br>
closed the two are in opposition, the current going through them in<br>
opposite senses. Thus one overcomes the effect of the other and the<br>
magnet core shows no magnetism, provided the two coils are of equal<br>
resistance and equal number of convolutions or turns.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Diffusion.</span><br>
A term properly applied to the varying current density found in<br>
conductors of unequal cross sectional area. In electro-therapeutics it<br>
is applied to the distribution of current as it passes through the human<br>
body. Its density per cross-sectional area varies with the area and<br>
with the other factors.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Diffusion Creep.</span><br>
When electrodes of an active circuit are immersed in a solution of an<br>
electrolyte, a current passes electrolytically if there is a sufficient<br>
potential difference. The current passes through all parts of the<br>
solution, spreading out of the direct prism connecting or defined by the<br>
electrodes. To this portion of the current the above term is applied. If<br>
the electrodes are small enough in proportion to the distance between<br>
them the current transmission or creep outside of the line becomes the<br>
principal conveyor of the current so that the resistance remains the<br>
same for all distances.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Dimensions and Theory of Dimensions.</span><br>
The expression of the unitary value of a physical quantity in one or<br>
more of the units of length (L), time (T) and mass (M) is termed the<br>
dimensions of such quantity. Thus the dimension or dimensions of a<br>
distance is simply L; of an angle, expressible by dividing the arc by<br>
the radius is L/L; of a velocity, expressible by distance divided by<br>
time--L/T; of acceleration, which is velocity acquired in a unit of<br>
time, and is therefore expressible by velocity divided by time--L/T/T or<br>
L/T2; of momentum, which is the product of mass into velocity--M*L/T; of<br>
kinetic energy taken as the product of mass into the square of<br>
velocity--M*(L2/T2); of potential energy taken as the product of mass<br>
into acceleration into space-M*(L/T2)*L reducing to M*(L2/T2). The<br>
theory is based on three fundamental units and embraces all electric<br>
quantities. The simple units generally taken are the gram, centimeter<br>
and second and the dimensions of the fundamental compound units are<br>
expressed in terms of these three, forming the centimeter-gram-second or<br>
C. G. S. system of units. Unless otherwise expressed or implied the<br>
letters L, M and T, may be taken to indicate centimeter, gram and second<br>
respectively. It is obvious that very complicated expressions of<br>
dimensions may be built up, and that a mathematical expression of<br>
unnamed quantities may be arrived at. Dimensions in their application by<br>
these symbols are subject to the laws of algebra. They were invented by<br>
Fourier and were brought into prominence by J. Clerk Maxwell. Another<br>
excellent definition reads as follows: "By the dimensions of a physical<br>
quantity we mean the quantities and powers of quantities, involved in<br>
the measurement of it." (W. T. A. Emtage.)<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Discharge, Brush.</span><br>
The static discharge of electricity into or through the air may be of<br>
the brush or spark form. The brush indicates the escape of electricity<br>
in continuous flow; the spark indicates discontinuity. The conditions<br>
necessary to the production of one or the other refer to the nature of<br>
the conductor, and of other conductors in its vicinity and to the<br>
electro-motive force or potential difference; small alterations may<br>
transform one into the other. The brush resembles a luminous core whose<br>
apex touches the conductor. It is accompanied by a slight hissing noise.<br>
Its luminosity is very feeble. The negative conductor gives a smaller<br>
brush than that of the positive conductor and discharges it more<br>
readily. When electricity issues from a conductor, remote from an<br>
oppositely excited one, it gives an absolutely silent discharge, showing<br>
at the point of escape a pale blue luminosity called electric glow, or<br>
if it escapes from points it shows a star-like centre of light. It can<br>
be seen in the dark by placing a point on the excited conductor of a<br>
static-electric machine.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Discharge, Convective.</span><br>
The discharge of static electricity from an excited conductor through<br>
air or rarefied gas; it is also called the quiet or silent discharge.<br>
The luminous effect in air or gas at atmospheric pressures takes the<br>
form of a little brush from a small positive electrode; the negative<br>
shows a star. The phenomena of Gassiot's cascade, the philosopher's egg<br>
and Geissler tubes, all of which may be referred to, are instances of<br>
convective discharge.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Discharge, Disruptive.</span><br>
A discharge of a static charge through a dielectric. It involves<br>
mechanical perforation of the dielectric, and hence the mere mechanical<br>
strength of the latter has much to do with preventing it. A disruptive<br>
discharge is often oscillatory in character; this is always the case<br>
with the discharge of a Leyden jar.<br>

The sudden or disruptive discharge of a static condenser, such as a<br>
Leyden jar, or of many other charged conductors, is oscillatory in<br>
character. The direction of the currents rapidly changes, so that the<br>
discharge is really an alternating current of excessively short total<br>
duration. The discharge sends electro-magnetic waves through the ether,<br>
which are exactly analogous to those of light but of too long period to<br>
affect the eye.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Discharge, Spark.</span><br>
The discontinuous discharge of high tension electricity through a<br>
dielectric or into the air produces electric sparks. These are quite<br>
strongly luminous, of branching sinuous shape, and in long sparks the<br>
luminosity varies in different parts of the same spark. A sharp noise<br>
accompanies each spark. High density of charge is requisite for the<br>
formation of long sparks.<br>

may be total, partial or intermittent, and due to many causes, such as<br>
open or partially replaced switches, oxidized or dirty contact points,<br>
or loose joints.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Displacement, Electric.</span><br>
A conception of the action of charging a dielectric. The charge is all<br>
on the surface. This fact being granted, the theory of displacement<br>
holds that charging a body is the displacing of electricity, forcing it<br>
from the interior on to the surface, or vice versa, producing a positive<br>

is due to a preponderance of negative fluid and vice versa. Like fluid<br>
repels like, and unlike attracts unlike; either fluid is attracted by<br>
matter; the presence in a body of one or the other induces<br>
electrification; united in equal proportions they neutralize each other,<br>
and friction, chemical decomposition and other causes effect their<br>
separation. The hypothesis, while convenient, is overshadowed by the<br>
certainty that electricity is not really a fluid at all. (See Single<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Dynamo, Alternating Current.</span><br>
A dynamo-electric machine for producing an alternating current; an<br>
alternator. They are classified by S. P. Thompson into three classes--I.<br>
Those with stationary field-magnet and rotating armature. II. Those with<br>
rotating field magnet and stationary armature. III. Those with both<br>
field magnet part and armature part stationary, the amount of magnetic<br>
induction from the latter through the former being caused to vary or<br>
alternate in direction by the revolution of appropriate pieces of iron,<br>
called inductors. Another division rests on whether they give one simple<br>
alternating current, a two phase current, or whether they give multi<br>
phase currents. (See Current, Alternating--Currents, Multiphase.)<br>
<br>
A great many kinds of alternators have been constructed. Only an outline<br>
of the general theory can be given here. They are generally multipolar,<br>
with north and south poles alternating around the field. The armature<br>
coils, equal in number in simple current machines, to the poles, are<br>
wound in opposite senses, so that the current shall be in one direction,<br>
though in opposite senses, in all of them at anyone time. As the<br>
armature rotates the coils are all approaching their poles at one time<br>
and a current in one sense is induced in every second coil, and one in<br>
the other sense in the other coils. They are all in continuous circuit<br>
with two open terminals, each connected to its own insulated connecting<br>
ring on the shaft. As the coils pass the poles and begin to recede from<br>
them the direction changes, and the current goes in the other direction<br>
until the next poles are reached and passed. Thus there are as many<br>
changes of direction of current per rotation as there are coils in the<br>
armature or poles in the field.<br>

<br>
The field-magnets whose windings may be in series are often excited by a<br>
separate direct current generation. Some are self-exciting, one or more<br>
of the armature coils being separated from the rest, and connected to a<br>
special commutator, which rectifies its current.<br>
<br>
By properly spacing the coils with respect to the poles of the field,<br>
and connecting each set of coils by itself to separate connecting rings,<br>
several currents can be taken from the same machine, which currents<br>
shall have a constant difference in phase. It would seem at first sight<br>
that the same result could be attained by using as many separate<br>
alternators as there were currents to be produced. But it would be<br>
almost impossible to preserve the exact relation of currents and current<br>
phase where each was produced by its own machine. The currents would<br>
overrun each other or would lag behind. In a single machine with<br>
separate sets of coils the relation is fixed and invariable.<br>

Regulation of.</span><br>
Transformers, converters, or induction coils are used to regulate<br>
alternating current dynamos, somewhat as compound winding is applied in<br>
the case of direct-current dynamos. The arrangement consists in<br>
connecting the primary of an induction coil or transformer into the<br>
external circuit with its secondary connected to the field circuit. Thus<br>
the transformer conveys current to the field picked up from the main<br>
circuit, and represents to some extent the shunt of a direct-current<br>
machine.<br>

Fig. 136. COMPOUND WOUND DYNAMO.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Dynamo. Compound.</span><br>
A compound wound dynamo; one which has two coils on its field magnet;<br>
one winding is in series with the external circuit and armature; the<br>
other winding is in parallel with the armature winding, or else with the<br>
armature winding and field winding, both in series. (See Winding, Long<br>
Shunt--Winding, Short Shunt.)<br>
<br>
Such a dynamo is, to a certain extent, self-regulating, the two coils<br>
counteracting each other, and bringing about a more regular action for<br>
varying currents than that of the ordinary shunt or series dynamo.<br>
<br>
The extent of the regulation of such a machine depends on the<br>
proportions given its different parts. However good the self-regulating<br>
may be in a compound wound machine, it can only be perfect at one<br>
particular speed.<br>
<br>
To illustrate the principle on which the approximate regulation is<br>
obtained the characteristic curve diagram may be consulted.<br>

One curve is the curve of a series winding, the other that of a shunt<br>
winding, and shows the variation of voltage in each with resistance in<br>
the external or working circuit. The variation is opposite in each case.<br>
It is evident that the two windings could be so proportioned on a<br>
compound machine that the resultant of the two curves would be a<br>
straight line. This regulation would then be perfect and automatic, but<br>
only for the one speed.<br>

<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Dynamo-electric Machine.</span><br>
A machine driven by power, generally steam power, and converting the<br>
mechanical energy expended on driving it into electrical energy of the<br>
current form. The parts of the ordinary dynamo may be summarized as<br>
follows: First, A circuit as complete as possible of iron. Such circuit<br>
is composed partly of the cores of an electro-magnet or of several<br>
electro-magnets, and partly of the cylindrical or ring-shaped core of an<br>
armature which fits as closely as practicable between the magnet ends or<br>
poles which are shaped so as to partly embrace it. Second, of coils of<br>
insulated wire wound upon the field-magnet cores. When these coils are<br>
excited the field-magnets develop polarity and the circuit just spoken<br>
of becomes a magnetic circuit, interrupted only by the air gaps between<br>
the poles and armatures. Thirdly, of coils of insulated wire upon the<br>
armature core. These coils when rotated in the magnetic field cut<br>
magnetic lines of force and develop electro-motive force.<br>
<br>
<br>
198&nbsp;&nbsp; STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.<br>
<br>
<br>
Fourthly, of collecting mechanism, the commutator in direct current<br>
dynamos, attached to the armature shaft and rotating with it. This<br>
consists of insulated rings, or segments of rings to which the wire<br>
coils of the armature are connected, and on which two springs of copper<br>
or plates of carbon or some other conductor presses. The electro-motive<br>
force developed by the cutting of lines of force, by the wires of the<br>
armature, shows itself as potential difference between the two springs.<br>
If the ends of a conductor are attached, one to each of these brushes,<br>
the potential difference will establish a current through the wire. By<br>
using properly divided and connected segments on the commutator the<br>
potential difference and consequent direction of the current may be kept<br>
always in the same sense or direction. It is now clear that the external<br>
wire may be connected with the windings of the field-magnet. In such<br>
case the excitement of the field-magnets is derived from the armature<br>
and the machine is self-excited and entirely self-contained.<br>
<br>
The above is a general description of a dynamo. Sometimes the coils of<br>
the field-magnets are not connected with the armature, but derive their<br>
current from an outside source. Such are termed separately excited<br>
dynamos.<br>
<br>
Some general features of dynamo generators may be seen in the<br>
definitions under this head and elsewhere. The general conception is to<br>
cut lines of force with a conductor and thus generate electromotive<br>
force, or in some way to change the number of lines of force within a<br>
loop or circuit with the same effect.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Dynamo, Electroplating.</span><br>
A dynamo designed for low potential and high current intensity. They are<br>
wound for low resistance, frequently several wires being used in<br>
parallel, or ribbon, bar or rectangular conductors being employed. They<br>
are of the direct current type. They should be shunt wound or they are<br>
liable to reverse. They are sometimes provided with resistance in the<br>
shunt, which is changed as desired to alter the electro-motive force.<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Dynamo, Equalizing.</span><br>
A combination for three and five-wire systems. A number of armatures or<br>
of windings on the same shaft are connected across the leads. If the<br>
potential drops at any pair of mains, the armature will begin to be<br>
driven by the other mains, acting to an extent as an element of a motor,<br>
and will raise the potential in the first pair.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Dynamo, Far Leading.</span><br>
A motor dynamo, used to compensate the drop of potential in long mains.<br>
Into the mains at a distant point a series motor is connected, driving a<br>
dynamo placed in shunt across the mains. The dynamo thus driven raises<br>
the potential difference between the two mains.<br>

A generator in which the armature or current-generating windings are all<br>
comprised upon the poles of the field magnets. Masses of iron, which<br>
should be laminated and are the inductors, are carried past the field<br>
magnet poles concentrating in their passage the lines of force, thus<br>

A name given by Prof. George Forbes to a dynamo invented by him. In it a<br>
cylinder of iron rotates within a perfectly self-contained iron-clad<br>
field magnet. The current is taken off by brushes bearing near the<br>
periphery, at two extremities of a diameter. A machine with a disc 18<br>
inches in diameter was said to give 3,117 amperes, with 5.8 volts E. M.<br>
F. running at 1,500 revolutions per second. The E. M. F. of such<br>

<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Dynamo, Open Coil.</span><br>
A dynamo the windings of whose armatures may be grouped in coils, which<br>
are not connected in series, but which have independent terminals. These<br>
terminals are separate divisions of the commutator and so spaced that<br>
the collecting brushes touch each pair belonging to the same coil<br>
simultaneously. As the brushes come in contact with the sections forming<br>
the terminals they take current from the coil in question. This coil is<br>
next succeeded by another one, and so on according to the number of<br>
coils employed.<br>

The relation of work done to energy absorbed. A theoretically perfect<br>

the efficiency in such case would be equal to 1. If a machine produced<br>
but half the work represented by the energy it absorbed, the rest<br>
disappearing in wasteful expenditure, in heating the bearings, in<br>
overcoming the resistance of the air and in other ways, its efficiency<br>

Practical efficiency of a machine, obtained by dividing the available<br>

machine. Thus in a dynamo part of the energy is usefully expended in<br>
exciting the field magnet, but this energy is not available for use in<br>
the outer circuit, is not a part of the output, and is not part of the<br>
dividend.<br>

If M represents the energy absorbed, and W the useful or available<br>
energy, the coefficient of commercial efficiency is equal to W/M. M is<br>
made up of available, unavailable and wasted (by Foucault currents,<br>

both wasted and useful or available to the useful or available<br>
electrical energy. If we call W the useful electric and w the wasted<br>
electric energy, the coefficient of electrical efficiency is equal to<br>
<br>
&nbsp; W / ( W + w )<br>
<br>
Synonyms--Intrinsic Efficiency--Economic Coefficient--Coefficient of<br>
Electrical Efficiency.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Efficiency of Conversion.</span><br>
In a dynamo or generator the relation of energy absorbed to total<br>
electric energy produced. Part of the electric energy is expended in<br>
producing the field and in other ways. Thus a generator with high<br>
efficiency of conversion may be a very poor one, owing to the<br>
unavailable electric energy which it produces. The coefficient of<br>
Efficiency of Conversion is obtained by dividing the total electric<br>
energy produced by the energy absorbed in working the dynamo. If M<br>
represents the energy absorbed, or work done in driving the dynamo or<br>
generator, W the useful electric, and w the wasted electrical energy,<br>
then the coefficient of efficiency of conversion is equal to<br>
<br>
(W + w ) / M<br>
<br>
In the quantity M are included besides available (W) and unavailable (w)<br>
electric energy, the totally wasted energy due to Foucault currents,<br>
etc., calling the latter m, the above formula may be given<br>
<br>
( W+ w ) / (W + w + m )<br>
<br>
This coefficient may refer to the action of a converter, q. v., in the<br>
alternating system. Synonym--Gross Efficiency.<br>

The phenomenon of the dielectric is described under this term. When a<br>
potential difference is established between two parts of the dielectric,<br>
a flow of electricity displacement current starts through the<br>
dielectric, which current is due to the electric stress, but is<br>
instantly arrested by what has been termed the electric elasticity of<br>
the dielectric. This is expressed by<br>
&nbsp; ( electric stress ) / ( electric strain )<br>
and in any substance is inversely proportional to the specific inductive<br>
capacity.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Electricity.</span><br>
It is impossible in the existing state of human knowledge to give a<br>
satisfactory definition of electricity. The views of various authorities<br>
are given here to afford a basis for arriving at the general consensus<br>
of electricians.<br>
<br>
We have as yet no conception of electricity apart from the electrified<br>
body; we have no experience of its independent existence. (J. E. H.<br>
Gordon.)<br>
<br>
What is Electricity? We do not know, and for practical purposes it is<br>
not necessary that we should know. (Sydney F. Walker.)<br>
<br>
Electricity &#8230; is one of those hidden and mysterious powers of nature<br>
which has thus become known to us through the medium of effects.<br>
(Weale's Dictionary of Terms.)<br>
<br>
This word Electricity is used to express more particularly the cause,<br>
which even today remains unknown, of the phenomena that we are about to<br>
explain. (Am&eacute;d&eacute;e Guillemin.)<br>
<br>
207&nbsp; STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.<br>
<br>
Electricity is a powerful physical agent which manifests itself mainly<br>
by attractions and repulsions, but also by luminous and heating effects,<br>
by violent commotions, by chemical decompositions, and many other<br>
phenomena. Unlike gravity, it is not inherent in bodies, but it is<br>
evoked in them by a variety of causes &#8230; (Ganot's Physics.)<br>
<br>
Electricity and magnetism are not forms of energy; neither are they<br>
forms of matter. They may, perhaps, be provisionally defined as<br>
properties or conditions of matter; but whether this matter be the<br>
ordinary matter, or whether it be, on the other hand, that<br>
all-pervading ether by which ordinary matter is surrounded, is a question<br>
which has been under discussion, and which now may be fairly held to be<br>
settled in favor of the latter view. (Daniell's Physics.)<br>
<br>
The name used in connection with an extensive and important class of<br>
phenomena, and usually denoting the unknown cause of the phenomena or<br>
the science that treats of them. (Imperial Dictionary.)<br>
<br>
Electricity. . . is the imponderable physical agent, cause, force or the<br>
molecular movement, by which, under certain conditions, certain<br>
phenomena, chiefly those of attraction and repulsion, . . . are<br>
produced. (John Angell.)<br>
<br>
It has been suggested that if anything can rightly be called<br>
"electricity," this must be the ether itself; and that all electrical<br>
and magnetic phenomena are simply due to changes, strains and motions in<br>
the ether. Perhaps negative electrification. . .means an excess of<br>
ether, and positive electrification a defect of ether, as compared with<br>
the normal density. (W. Larden.)<br>
<br>
Electricity is the name given to the supposed agent producing the<br>
described condition (i. e. electrification) of bodies. (Fleeming<br>
Jenkin.)<br>
<br>
There are certain bodies which, when warm and dry, acquire by friction,<br>
the property of attracting feathers, filaments of silk or indeed any<br>
light body towards them. This property is called Electricity, and bodies<br>
which possess it are said to be electrified. (Linnaeus Cumming.)<br>
<br>
What electricity is it is impossible to say, but for the present it is<br>
convenient to look upon it as a kind of invisible something which<br>
pervades all bodies. (W. Perren Maycock.)<br>
<br>
What is electricity? No one knows. It seems to be one manifestation of<br>
the energy which fills the universe and which appears in a variety of<br>
other forms, such as heat, light, magnetism, chemical affinity,<br>
mechanical motion, etc. (Park Benjamin.)<br>
<br>
<br>
208&nbsp;&nbsp; STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.<br>
<br>
<br>
The theory of electricity adopted throughout these lessons is, that<br>
electricity, whatever its true nature, is one, not two; that this<br>
Electricity, whatever it may prove to be, is not matter, and is not<br>
energy; that it resembles both matter and energy in one respect,<br>
however, in that it can neither be created nor destroyed. (Sylvanus P.<br>
Thomson.)<br>
<br>
In Physics a name denoting the cause of an important class of phenomena<br>
of attraction and repulsion, chemical decomposition, etc., or,<br>
collectively, these phenomena themselves. (Century Dictionary.)<br>
<br>
A power in nature, often styled the electric fluid, exhibiting itself,<br>
when in disturbed equilibrium or in activity, by a circuit movement, the<br>
fact of direction in which involves polarity, or opposition of<br>
properties in opposite directions; also, by attraction for many<br>
substances, by a law involving attraction between substances of unlike<br>
polarity, and repulsion between those of like; by exhibiting accumulated<br>
polar tension when the circuit is broken; and by producing heat, light,<br>
concussion, and often chemical changes when the circuit passes between<br>
the poles, or through any imperfectly conducting substance or space. It<br>
is evolved in any disturbance of molecular equilibrium, whether from a<br>
chemical, physical, or mechanical cause. (Webster's Dictionary.)<br>
<br>
In point of fact electricity is not a fluid at all, and only in a few of<br>
its attributes is it at all comparable to a fluid. Let us rather<br>
consider electricity to be a condition into which material substances<br>
are thrown. . .(Slingo &amp; Brooker.)<br>

<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Electro-capillarity.</span><br>
The relations between surface tension, the potential difference and the<br>
electrostatic capacity of fluids in contact. Although nominally in<br>
contact such surfaces are separated by about one-twenty-millionth of a<br>
centimeter (1/50000000 inch) ; thus a globule of mercury and water in<br>
which it is immersed constitute an electrostatic accumulator of definite<br>
electrostatic capacity. Again the mercury and water being in electric<br>
connection differ in potential by contact (see Contact Theory). A<br>
definite surface tension is also established. Any change in one of these<br>
factors changes the other also. A current passed through the contact<br>
surfaces will change the surface tension and hence the shape of the<br>
mercury globule. Shaking the globule will change its shape and capacity<br>
and produce a current. Heating will do the same. (See Electrometer,<br>
Capillary; and Telephone, Capillary.) Mercury and water are named as<br>
liquids in which the phenomena are most conveniently observed. They are<br>
observable in other parallel cases.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Electro-chemical Equivalent.</span><br>
The quantity of an element or compound liberated from or brought into<br>
combination, electrolytically, by one coulomb of electricity. The<br>
electro-chemical equivalent of hydrogen is found by experiment to be<br>
.0000105 gram. That of any other substance is found by multiplying this<br>
weight by its chemical equivalent referred to hydrogen, which is its<br>
atomic or molecular weight divided by its valency. Thus the atomic<br>
weight of oxygen is 16, its valency is 2, its equivalent is 16/2 = 8;<br>
its electro-chemical equivalent is equal to .0000105 X 8 = .000840 gram.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Electro-chemical Series.</span><br>
An arrangement of the elements in the order of their relative electrical<br>
affinities so that each element is electro-negative to all the elements<br>
following it, and electro-positive to the elements preceding it. The<br>
usual series begins with oxygen as the most electro-negative and ends<br>
with potassium as the most electro-positive element. There is, of<br>
course, no reason why other series of compound radicals, such as<br>
sulphion (SO4), etc., should not also be constructed. For each liquid<br>
acting on substances a separate series of the substances acted on may be<br>
constructed. Thus for dilute sulphuric acid the series beginning with<br>
the negatively charged or most attacked one is zinc, amalgamated or<br>
pure, cadmium, iron, tin, lead, aluminum, nickel, antimony, bismuth,<br>
copper, silver, platinum. In other liquids the series is altogether<br>
different.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Electro-dynamometer, Siemens'.</span><br>
An apparatus for measuring currents by the reaction between two coils,<br>
one fixed and one movable, through which the current to be measured<br>
passes. It is one of the oldest commercial ammeters or current<br>
measurers. It comprises a fixed coil of a number of convolutions and a<br>
movable coil often of only one convolution surrounding the other. The<br>
movable coil is suspended by a filament or thread from a spiral spring.<br>
The spring is the controlling factor. Connection is established through<br>
mercury cups so as to bring the two coils in series. In use the spring<br>
and filament are adjusted by turning a milled head to which they are<br>
connected until the coils are at right angles. Then the current is<br>
turned on and deflects the movable coil. The milled head is turned until<br>
the deflection is overcome. The angle through which the head is turned<br>
is proportional to the square of the current. The movable coil must in<br>
its position at right angles to the fixed one lie at right angles to the<br>
magnetic meridian.<br>
<br>
Thus in the diagram, Fig. 143 A B C D is the fixed coil; E F G H is the<br>
movable coil; S is the spiral spring attached at K to the movable coil.<br>

<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Electrolysis.</span><br>
The separation of a chemical compound into its constituent parts or<br>
elements by the action of the electric current. The compound may be<br>
decomposed into its elements, as water into hydrogen and oxygen, or into<br>
constituent radicals, as sodium sulphate into sodium and sulphion, which<br>
by secondary reactions at once give sodium hydrate and sulphuric acid.<br>
The decomposition proceeds subject to the laws of electrolysis. (See<br>
Electrolysis, Laws of.) For decomposition to be produced there is for<br>
each compound a minimum electro-motive force or potential difference<br>
required. The current passes through the electrolyte or substance<br>
undergoing decomposition entirely by Electrolytic Conduction, q. v. in<br>
accordance with Groth&uuml;ss' Hypothesis, q. v. The electrolyte
therefore<br>
must be susceptible of diffusion and must be a fluid.<br>
<br>
The general theory holds that under the influence of a potential<br>
difference between electrodes immersed in an electrolyte, the molecules<br>
touching the electrodes are polarized, in the opposite sense for each<br>
electrode. If the potential difference is sufficient the molecules will<br>
give up one of their binary constituents to the electrode, and the other<br>
constituent will decompose the adjoining molecule, and that one being<br>
separated into the same two constituents will decompose its neighbor,<br>
and so on through the mass until the other electrode is reached. This<br>
one separates definitely the second binary constituent from the<br>
molecules touching it.<br>
<br>
<br>
213&nbsp;&nbsp; STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.<br>
<br>
<br>
Thus there is an exact balance preserved. Just as many molecules are<br>
decomposed at one electrode as at the other, and the exact chain of<br>
decomposition runs through the mass. Each compound electrolyzed develops<br>
a binary or two-fold composition, and gives up one constituent to one<br>
electrode and the other to the other.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Electrolysis, Laws of.</span><br>
The following are the principal laws, originally discovered by<br>
Faraday, and sometimes called Faraday's Laws of Electrolysis:<br>
<br>
1. Electrolysis cannot take place unless the electrolyte is a conductor.<br>
Conductor here means an electrolytic conductor, one that conducts by its<br>
own molecules traveling, and being decomposed. (See Groth&uuml;ss'<br>
Hypothesis.)<br>
<br>
II. The energy of the electrolytic action of the current is the same<br>
wherever exercised in different parts of the circuit.<br>
<br>
III. The same quantity of electricity--that is the same current for the<br>
same period----- decomposes chemically equivalent quantities of the<br>
bodies it decomposes, or the weights of elements separated in<br>
electrolytes by the same quantity of electricity (in coulombs or some<br>
equivalent unit) are to each other as their chemical equivalent.<br>
<br>
IV. The quantity of a body decomposed in a given time is proportional to<br>
the strength of the current.<br>
<br>
To these may be added the following:<br>
<br>
V. A definite and fixed electro-motive force is required for the<br>
decomposition of each compound, greater for some and less for others.<br>
Without sufficient electro-motive force expended on the molecule no<br>
decomposition will take place. (See Current, Convective.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Electrolyte.</span><br>
A body susceptible of decomposition by the electric current, and capable<br>
of electrolytic conduction. It must be a fluid body and therefore<br>
capable of diffusion, and composite in composition. An elemental body<br>
cannot be an electrolyte.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Electrolytic Analysis.</span><br>
Chemical analysis by electrolysis. The quantitative separation of a<br>
number of metals can be very effectively executed. Thus, suppose that a<br>
solution of copper sulphate was to be analyzed. A measured portion of<br>
the solution would be introduced into a weighed platinum vessel. The<br>
vessel would be connected to the zinc plate terminal of a battery. From<br>
the other terminal of the battery a wire would be brought and would<br>
terminate in a plate of platinum. This would be immersed in the solution<br>
in the vessel. As the current would pass the copper sulphate would be<br>
decomposed and eventually all the copper would be deposited in a firm<br>
coating on the platinum. The next operations would be to wash the metal<br>
with distilled water, and eventually with alcohol, to dry and to weigh<br>
the dish with the adherent copper. On subtracting the weight of the dish<br>
alone from the weight of the dish and copper, the weight of the metallic<br>
copper in the solution would be obtained.<br>
<br>
In similar ways many other determinations are effected. The processes of<br>
analysis include solution of the ores or other substances to be analyzed<br>
and their conversion into proper form for electrolysis. Copper as just<br>
described can be precipitated from the solution of its sulphate. For<br>
iron and many other metals solutions of their double alkaline oxalates<br>
are especially available forms for analysis.<br>
<br>
The entire subject has been worked out in considerable detail by<br>
Classen, to whose works reference should be made for details of<br>
processes.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Electrolytic Convection.</span><br>
It is sometimes observed that a single cell of Daniell battery, for<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Electrolytic Conduction.</span><br>
Conduction by the travel of atoms or radicals from molecule to molecule<br>
of a substance with eventual setting free at the electrodes of the atoms<br>
or radicals as elementary molecules or constituent radicals. A substance<br>
to be capable of acting as an electrolytic conductor must be capable of<br>
diffusion, and must also have electrolytic conductivity. Such a body is<br>
called an electrolyte. (See Groth&uuml;ss' Hypothesis--Electrolysis--<br>
Electrolysis, Laws of--Electro-chemical Equivalent.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Electro-magnet.</span><br>
A mass, in practice always of iron, around which an electric circuit is<br>
carried, insulated from the iron. When a current is passed through the<br>
circuit the iron presents the characteristics of a magnet. (See<br>
Magnetism, Amp&eacute;re's Theory of--Solenoid--Lines of Force.) In
general<br>
terms the action of a circular current is to establish lines of force<br>
that run through the axis of the circuit approximately parallel thereto,<br>
and curving out of and over the circuit, return into themselves outside<br>
of the circuit. If a mass of iron is inserted in the axis or elsewhere<br>
near such current, it multiplies within itself the lines of force, q. v.<br>
(See also Magnetic Permeability--Permeance--Magnetic Induction,<br>
Coefficient of Magnetic Susceptibility--Magnetization, Coefficient of<br>
Induced.) These lines of force make it a magnet. On their direction,<br>
which again depends on the direction of the magnetizing current, depends<br>
the polarity of the iron. The strength of an electro-magnet, below<br>
saturation of the core (see Magnetic Saturation), is proportional nearly<br>
to the ampere-turns, q. v. More turns for the same current or more<br>
current for the same turns increase its strength.<br>
<br>
In the cut is shown the general relation of current, coils, core and<br>
line of force. Assume that the magnet is looked at endwise, the observer<br>
facing one of the poles; then if the current goes around the core in the<br>
direction opposite to that of the hands of a clock, such pole will be<br>
the north pole. If the current is in the direction of the hands of a<br>
clock the pole facing the observer will be the south pole. The whole<br>
relation is exactly that of the theoretical Amp&eacute;rian currents,
already<br>
explained. The direction and course of the lines of force created are<br>
shown in the cut.<br>
<br>
The shapes of electro-magnets vary greatly. The cuts show several forms<br>
of electro- magnets. A more usual form is the horseshoe or double limb<br>
magnet, consisting generally of two straight cores, wound with wire and<br>
connected and held parallel to each other by a bar across one end, which<br>
bar is called the yoke.<br>
<br>
In winding such a magnet the wire coils must conform, as regards<br>
direction of the current in them to the rule for polarity already cited.<br>
If both poles are north or both are south poles, then the magnet cannot<br>
be termed a horseshoe magnet, but is merely an anomalous magnet. In the<br>
field magnets of dynamos the most varied types of electro-magnets have<br>
been used. Consequent poles are often produced in them by the direction<br>
of the windings and connections.<br>
<br>
To obtain the most powerful magnet the iron core should be as short and<br>
thick as possible in order to diminish the reluctance of the magnetic<br>
circuit. To obtain a greater range of action a long thin shape is<br>
better, although it involves waste of energy in its excitation.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Electro-magnetic Attraction and
Repulsion.</span><br>
The attraction and repulsion due to electromagnetic lines of force,<br>
which lines always tend to take as short a course as possible and also<br>
seek the medium of the highest permeance. This causes them to<br>
concentrate in iron and steel or other paramagnetic substance and to<br>
draw them towards a magnet by shortening the lines of force connecting<br>
the two. It is exactly the same attraction as that of the permanent<br>
magnet for its armature, Amp&eacute;re's theory bringing the latter
under the<br>
same title. In the case of two magnets like poles repel and unlike<br>
attract. In the case of simple currents, those in the same direction<br>
attract and those in opposite directions repel each other. This refers<br>
to constant current reactions. Thus the attraction of unlike poles of<br>
two magnets is, by the Amp&eacute;rian theory, the attraction of two
sets of<br>
currents of similar direction, as is evident from the diagram. The<br>
repulsion of like poles is the repulsion of unlike currents and the same<br>
applies to solenoids, q. v. (See Magnetism and do. Amp&eacute;re's

Control of a magnet, iron armature, or magnetic needle in a<br>

electro-magnetic field, the restitutive force being derived from an<br>
electro-magnet. The restitutive force is the force tending to bring the<br>
index to zero.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Electro-magnetic Field of Force.</span><br>
A field of electro-magnetic lines of force, q. v., established through<br>
the agency of an electric current. A wire carrying a current is<br>
surrounded by circular concentric lines of force which have the axis of<br>
the wire as the locus of their centres. Electro-magnets produce lines of<br>
force identical with those produced by permanent magnets. (See Field of<br>
Force--Magnetic Field of Force--Controlling Field--Deflecting Field.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Electro-magnetic Induction.</span><br>
When two currents of unlike direction are brought towards each other,<br>
against their natural repulsive tendency work is done, and the<br>
consequent energy takes the form of a temporary increase in both<br>
currents. When withdrawn, in compliance with the natural tendency of<br>
repulsion, the currents are diminished in intensity, because energy is<br>
not expended on the withdrawal, but the withdrawal is at the expense of<br>
the energy of the system. The variations thus temporarily produced in<br>
the currents are examples of electro-magnetic induction. The currents<br>
have only the duration in each case of the motion of the circuits. One<br>
circuit is considered as carrying the inducer current and is termed the<br>
primary circuit and its current the primary current, the others are<br>
termed the secondary circuit and current respectively. We may assume a<br>
secondary circuit in which there is no current. It is probable that<br>
there is always an infinitely small current at least, in every closed<br>
circuit. Then an approach of the circuits will induce in the secondary<br>
an instantaneous current in the reverse direction. On separating the two<br>
circuits a temporary current in the same direction is produced in the<br>
secondary.<br>
<br>
<br>
219&nbsp; STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.<br>
<br>
<br>
A current is surrounded by lines of force. The approach of two circuits,<br>
one active, involves a change in the lines of force about the secondary<br>
circuit. Lines of force and current are so intimately connected that a<br>
change in one compels a change in the other. Therefore the induced<br>
current in the secondary may be attributed to the change in the field of<br>
force in which it lies, a field maintained by the primary circuit and<br>
current. Any change in a field of force induces a current or change of<br>
current in any closed circuit in such field, lasting as long as the<br>
change is taking place. The new current will be of such direction as to<br>
oppose the change. (See Lenz's Law.)<br>
<br>
The action as referred to lines of force may be figured as the cutting<br>
of such lines by the secondary circuit, and such cutting may be brought<br>
about by moving the secondary in the field. (See Lines of Force--Field<br>
of Force.) The cutting of 1E8 lines of force per second by a closed<br>
circuit induces an electro-motive force of one volt. (See Induction,<br>
Mutual, Coefficient of.)<br>

<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Electro-magnetic Theory of Light.</span><br>
This theory is due to J. Clark Maxwell, and the recent Hertz experiments<br>
have gone far to prove it. It holds that the phenomena of light are due<br>
to ether waves, identical in general factors with those produced by<br>
electro-magnetic induction of alternating currents acting on the ether.<br>
In a non-conductor any disturbance sets an ether wave in motion owing to<br>
its restitutive force; electricity does not travel through such a<br>
medium, but can create ether waves in it. Therefore a non-conductor of<br>
electricity is permeable to waves of ether or should transmit light, or<br>
should be transparent. A conductor on the other hand transmits<br>
electrical disturbances because it has no restitutive force and cannot<br>
support an ether wave. Hence a conductor should not transmit light, or<br>
should be opaque. With few exceptions dielectrics or non-conductors are<br>
transparent, and conductors are opaque.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
Again, the relation between the electrostatic and electro-magnet units<br>
of quantity is expressed by 1 : 30,000,000,000; the latter figure in<br>
centimeters gives approximately the velocity of light. The<br>
electro-magnetic unit depending on electricity in motion should have<br>
this precise relation if an electro-magnetic disturbance was propagated<br>
with the velocity of light. If an electrically charged body were whirled<br>
around a magnetic needle with the velocity of light, it should act in<br>
the same way as a current circulating around it. This effect to some<br>
extent has been shown experimentally by Rowland.<br>
<br>
A consequence of these conclusions is (Maxwell) that the specific<br>
inductive capacity of a non-conductor or dielectric should be equal to<br>
the square of its index of refraction for waves of infinite length. This<br>
is true for some substances--sulphur, turpentine, petroleum and benzole.<br>
In others the specific inductive capacity is too high, e. g., vegetable<br>
and animal oils, glass, Iceland spar, fluor spar, and quartz.<br>

Electro-magnets so arranged that their armatures interlock. Thus two<br>

right angles and both normally pulled away from the poles. When the<br>
armature M is attracted a catch on its end is retained by a hole in the<br>
end of the other armature N, and when the latter armature N is attracted<br>
by its magnet the armature M is released. In the mechanism shown in the<br>
cut the movements of the wheel R are controlled. Normally it is held<br>
motionless by the catch upon the bottom of the armature M, coming<br>
against the tooth projecting from its periphery. A momentary current<br>
through the coils of the magnet A A releases it, by attracting M, which<br>
is caught and retained by N, and leaves it free to rotate. A momentary<br>
current through the coils of the magnet B B again releases M, which<br>
drops down and engages the tooth upon R and arrests its motion.<br>

An electrometer designed to give directly the value of a charge in<br>

conducting surface. The poised plate is surrounded by a detached guard<br>
ring--an annular or perforated plate, r g r' g'--exactly level and even<br>
with it as regards the upper surface. The inner plate is carried by a<br>
delicate balance. In use it is connected to one of the conductors and<br>
the lower plate to earth or to the other. The attraction between them is<br>
determined by weighing. By calculation the results can be made absolute,<br>
as they depend on actual size of the plates and their distance, outside<br>
of the potential difference of which of course nothing can be said. If S<br>

difference of their potential, which is to be measured, and F the force<br>
required to balance their attraction, we have:<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Electrometer, Capillary.</span><br>
An electrometer for measuring potential difference by capillary action,<br>
which latter is affected by electrostatic excitement. A tube A contains<br>
mercury; its end drawn out to a fine aperture dips into a vessel B which<br>
contains dilute sulphuric acid with mercury under it, as shown. Wires<br>
running from the binding-posts a and b connect one with the mercury in<br>
A, the other with that in B. The upper end of the tube A connects with a<br>
thick rubber mercury reservoir T, and manometer H. The surface tension<br>
of the mercury-acid film at the lower end of the tube A keeps all in<br>
equilibrium. If now a potential difference is established between a and<br>
b, as by connecting a battery thereto, the surface tension is increased<br>
and the mercury rises in the tube B. By screwing down the compressing<br>
clamp E, the mercury is brought back to its original position. The<br>
microscope M is used to determine this position with accuracy. The<br>
change in reading of the manometer gives the relation of change of<br>
surface tension and therefore of potential. Each electrometer needs<br>
special graduation or calibration, but is exceedingly sensitive and<br>
accurate. It cannot be used for greater potential differences than .6<br>
volt, but can measure .0006 volt. Its electrostatic capacity is so small<br>
that it can indicate rapid changes. Another form indicates potential<br>
difference by the movement of a drop of sulphuric acid in a horizontal<br>
glass tube, otherwise filled with mercury, and whose ends lead into two<br>
mercury cups or reservoirs. The pair of electrodes to be tested are<br>
connected to the mercury vessels. The drop moves towards the negative<br>
pole, and its movement for small potential differences (less than one<br>
volt) is proportional to the electro-motive force or potential<br>
difference.<br>

A Leyden jar with mounted discharger, so that when charged to a certain<br>
point it discharges itself. It is connected with one coating of any jar<br>
whose charge is to be measured, which jar is then charged by the other<br>
coating. As the jar under trial becomes charged to a certain point the<br>
electrometer jar discharges itself, and the number of discharges is the<br>
measure of the charge of the other jar. It is really a unit jar, q. v.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Electrometer, Quadrant.</span><br>
(a) Sir William Thomson's electrometer, a simple form of which is shown<br>
in the cut, consists of four quadrants of metal placed horizontally;<br>
above these a broad flat aluminum needle hangs by a very fine wire,<br>
acting as torsional suspension. The quadrants are insulated from each<br>
other, but the opposite ones connect with each other by wires. The<br>
apparatus is adjusted so that, when the quadrants are in an unexcited<br>
condition the needle is at rest over one of the diametrical divisions<br>
between quadrants. The needle by its suspension wire is in communication<br>
with the interior of a Leyden jar which is charged. The whole is covered<br>
with a glass shade, and the air within is kept dry by a dish of<br>
concentrated sulphuric acid so that the jar retains its charge for a<br>
long time and keeps the needle at approximately a constant potential. If<br>
now two pairs of quadrants are excited with opposite electricities, as<br>
when connected with the opposite poles of an insulated galvanic cell,<br>
the needle is repelled by one pair and attracted by the other, and<br>
therefore rotates through an arc of greater or less extent. A small<br>
concave mirror is attached above the needle and its image is reflected<br>
on a graduated screen. This makes the smallest movement visible.<br>
Sometimes the quadrants are double, forming almost a complete box,<br>
within which the needle moves.<br>
<br>
(b) Henley's quadrant electrometer is for use on the prime conductor of<br>
an electric machine, for roughly indicating the relative potential<br>
thereof. It consists of a wooden standard attached perpendicularly to<br>
the conductor. Near one end is attached a semi-circular or quadrant arc<br>
of a circle graduated into degrees or angular divisions. An index,<br>
consisting of a straw with a pith-bell attached to its end hangs from<br>
the center of curvature of the arc. When the prime conductor is charged<br>
the index moves up over the scale and its extent of motion indicates the<br>
potential relatively.<br>
<br>
When the "quadrant electrometer" is spoken of it may always be assumed<br>
that Sir William Thomson's instrument is alluded to. Henley's instrument<br>
is properly termed a quadrant electroscope. (See Electroscope.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Electro-motive Force.</span><br>
The cause which produces currents of electricity. In general it can be<br>
expressed in difference of potentials, although the term electro-motive<br>
force should be restricted to potential difference causing a current. It<br>
is often a sustained charging of the generator terminals whence the<br>
current is taken. Its dimensions are<br>
<br>
(work done/the quantity of electricity involved),<br>
<br>
or ( M * (L^2) /(T^2 ) ) / ((M^.5) * (L^.5)) = ( (M^.5) * (L^1.5) )
/(T^2)<br>
<br>
The practical unit of electro-motive force is the volt, q. v. It is<br>
often expressed in abbreviated form, as E. M. D. P., or simply as D. P.,<br>
i. e., potential difference.<br>
<br>
Electro-motive force and potential difference are in many cases<br>
virtually identical, and distinctions drawn between them vary with<br>
different authors. If we consider a closed electric circuit carrying a<br>
current, a definite electro-motive force determined by Ohm's law from<br>
the resistance and current obtains in it. But if we attempt to define<br>
potential difference as proper to the circuit we may quite fail.<br>
Potential difference in a circuit is the difference in potential between<br>
defined points of such circuit. But no points in a closed circuit can be<br>
found which differ in potential by an amount equal to the entire<br>
electro-motive force of the circuit. Potential difference is properly<br>
the measure of electro-motive force expended on the portion of a circuit<br>
between any given points. Electro-motive force of an entire circuit, as<br>
it is measured, as it were, between two consecutive points but around<br>
the long portion of the circuit, is not conceivable as merely potential<br>
difference. Taking the circle divided in to degrees as an analogy, the<br>
electro-motive force of the entire circuit might be expressed as
360&ordm;,<br>
which are the degrees intervening between two consecutive points,<br>
measured the long way around the circle. But the potential difference<br>
between the same two points would be only 1&ordm;, for it would be
measured<br>
by the nearest path.<br>
<br>
[Transcriber's notes: If 360&ordm; is the "long" way, 0&ordm; is the
"short". A<br>
formal restatement of the above definition of EMF: "If a charge Q passes<br>
through a device and gains energy U, the net EMF for that device is the<br>
energy gained per unit charge, or U/Q. The unit of EMF is a volt, or<br>
newton-meter per coulomb."]<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Electro-motive Force, Counter.</span><br>
A current going through a circuit often has not only true or ohmic<br>
resistance to overcome, but meets an opposing E. M. F. This is termed<br>
counter-electro-motive force. It is often treated in calculations as<br>
resistance, and is termed spurious resistance. It may be a part of the<br>
impedance of a circuit.<br>
<br>
In a primary battery hydrogen accumulating on the negative plate<br>
develops counter E. M. F. In the voltaic arc the differential heating of<br>
the two carbons does the same. The storage battery is changed by a<br>
current passing in the opposite direction to its own natural current;<br>
the polarity of such a battery is counter E. M. F.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Electro-motive Force, Unit.</span><br>
Unit electro-motive force is that which is created in a conductor moving<br>
through a magnetic field at such a rate as to cut one unit line of force<br>
per second. It is that which must be maintained in a circuit of unit<br>
resistance to maintain a current of unit quantity therein. It is that<br>
which must be maintained between the ends of a conductor in order that<br>
unit current may do unit work in a second.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Electro-motive Intensity.</span><br>
The force acting upon a unit charge of electricity. The mean force is<br>
equal to the difference of potential between two points within the field<br>
situated one centimeter apart, such distance being measured along the<br>
lines of force. The term is due to J. Clerk Maxwell.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Electro-motograph.</span><br>
An invention of Thomas A. Edison. A cylinder of chalk, moistened with<br>
solution of caustic soda, is mounted so as to be rotated by a handle. A<br>
diaphragm has an arm connected to its center. This arm is pressed<br>
against the surface of the cylinder by a spring. When the cylinder is<br>
rotated, a constant tension is exerted on the diaphragm. If a current is<br>
passed through the junction of arm and cylinder the electrolytic action<br>
alters the friction so as to change the stress upon the diaphragm.<br>
<br>
If the current producing this effect is of the type produced by the<br>
human voice through a microphone the successive variations in strain<br>
upon the diaphragm will cause it to emit articulate sounds. These are<br>
produced directly by the movement of the cylinder, the electrolytic<br>
action being rather the regulating portion of the operation. Hence very<br>
loud sounds can be produced by it. This has given it the name of the<br>
loud- speaking telephone.<br>
<br>
The same principle may be applied in other ways. But the practical<br>
application of the motograph is in the telephone described.<br>

<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Electrophorous.</span><br>
An apparatus for the production of electric charges of high potential by<br>
electrostatic induction, q. v. It consists of a disc of insulating<br>
material B, such as resin or gutta percha, which is held in a shallow<br>
metal-lined box or form. The disc may be half an inch thick and a foot<br>
or more in diameter, or may be much smaller and thinner. A metal disc A,<br>
smaller in diameter is provided with an insulating handle which may be<br>
of glass, or simply silk suspension strings. To use it the disc B is<br>
excited by friction with a cat-skin or other suitable substance. The<br>
metallic disc is then placed on the cake of resin exactly in its centre,<br>
so that the latter disc or cake projects on all sides. Owing to<br>
roughness there is little real electric contact between the metal and<br>
dielectric. On touching the metal disc a quantity of negative<br>
electricity escapes to the earth. On raising it from the cake it comes<br>
off excited positively, and gives a spark and is discharged. It can be<br>
replaced, touched, removed and another spark can be taken from it, and<br>
so on as long as the cake stays charged.<br>
<br>
The successive discharges represent electrical energy expended. This is<br>
derived from the muscular energy expended by the operator in separating<br>
the two discs when oppositely excited. As generally used it is therefore<br>
an apparatus for converting muscular or mechanical energy into electric<br>
energy.<br>

<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Electro-physiology.</span><br>
The science of the electric phenomena of the animal system. It may also<br>
be extended to include plants. The great discovery of Galvani with the<br>
frog's body fell into this branch of science. The electric fishes,<br>
gymnotus, etc., present intense phenomena in the same.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Electroplating.</span><br>
The deposition by electrolysis of a coating of metal upon a conducting<br>
surface. The simplest system makes the object to be plated the negative<br>
electrode or plate in a galvanic couple. Thus a spoon or other object<br>
may be connected by a wire to a plate of zinc. A porous cup is placed<br>
inside a battery jar. The spoon is placed in the porous cup and the zinc<br>
outside it. A solution of copper sulphate is placed in the porous cup,<br>
and water with a little sodium or zinc sulphate dissolved in it,<br>
outside. A current starts through the couple, and copper is deposited on<br>
the spoon.<br>
<br>
A less primitive way is to use a separate battery as the source of<br>
current; to connect to the positive plate by a wire the object to be<br>
plated, and a plate of copper, silver, nickel or other metal to the<br>
other pole of the battery. On immersing both object and plate (anode) in<br>
a bath of proper solution the object will become plated.<br>
<br>
In general the anode is of the same material as the metal to be<br>
deposited, and dissolving keeps up the strength of the bath. There are a<br>
great many points of technicality involved which cannot be given here.<br>
The surface of the immersed object must be conductive. If not a fine<br>
wire network stretched over it will gradually fill up in the bath and<br>
give a matrix. More generally the surface is made conductive by being<br>
brushed over with plumbago. This may be followed by a dusting of iron<br>
dust, followed by immersion in solution ot copper sulphate. This has the<br>
effect of depositing metallic copper over the surface as a starter for<br>
the final coat.<br>
<br>
Attention must be paid to the perfect cleanliness of the objects, to the<br>
condition of the bath, purity of anodes and current density.<br>
<br>
Voltaic batteries are largely used for the current as well as special<br>
low resistance dynamos. Thermo-electric batteries are also used to some<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Electropoion Fluid.</span><br>
An acid depolarizing solution for use in zinc-carbon couples, such as<br>
the Grenet battery. The following are formulae for its preparation:<br>
<br>
(a) Dissolve one pound of potassium bichromate in ten pounds of water,<br>
to which two and one-half pounds of concentrated sulphuric acid have<br>
been gradually added. The better way is to use powdered potassium<br>
bichromate, add it to the water first, and then gradually add the<br>
sulphuric acid with constant stirring.<br>
<br>
(b) To three pints of water add five fluid ounces of concentrated<br>
sulphuric acid; add six ounces pulverized potassium bichromate.<br>
<br>
(c) Mix one gallon concentrated sulphuric acid and three gallons of<br>
water. In a separate vessel dissolve six pounds potassium bichromate in<br>
two gallons of boiling water. Mix the two.<br>
<br>
The last is the best formula. Always use electropoion fluid cold. (See<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Electroscope.</span><br>
An apparatus for indicating the presence of an electric charge, and also<br>
for determining the sign, or whether the charge is positive or negative.<br>
The simplest form consists of a thread doubled at its centre and hung<br>
therefrom. On being charged, or on being connected to a charged body the<br>
threads diverge. A pair of pith balls may be suspended in a similar way,<br>
or a couple of strips of gold leaf within a flask (the gold leaf<br>
electroscope). To use an electroscope to determine the sign of the<br>
charge it is first slightly charged. The body to be tested is then<br>
applied to the point of suspension, or other charging point. If at once<br>
further repelled the charge of the body is of the same sign as the<br>
slight charge first imparted to the electroscope leaves; the leaves as<br>
they become more excited will at once diverge more. If of different sign<br>
they will at first approach as their charge is neutralized and will<br>
afterwards diverge.<br>
<br>
The gold-leaf electroscope is generally enclosed in a glass bell jar or<br>
flask. Sometimes a pair of posts rise, one on each side, to supply<br>
points of induction from the earth to intensify the action. (See<br>

distance from the opposite poles of two dry piles (see Zamboni's Dry<br>
Pile) standing on end, one on each side of it. As soon as the leaf is<br>
excited it moves toward one and away from the other pile, and the sign<br>
of its electrification is shown by the direction of its motion.<br>

leaves of gold are suspended or connected.<br>
<br>
In use the object to be tested is touched to the lower plate, and the<br>
upper plate at the same time is touched by the finger. The plates are<br>
now separated. This reduces the capacity of the lower plate greatly and<br>
its charge acquires sufficient potential to affect the leaves, although<br>
the simple touching may not have affected them at all.<br>

<br>
The cut, Fig. 161, shows the general course taken by lines of force<br>
between two excited surfaces when near together. Here most of them are<br>
straight lines reaching straight across from surface to surface, while a<br>
few of them arch across from near the edges, tending to spread. If the<br>
bodies are drawn apart the spreading tendency increases and the<br>
condition of things shown in the next cut, Fig. 162, obtains. There is<br>
an axial line whose prolongations may be supposed to extend<br>
indefinitely, as occupying a position of unstable equilibrium. Here the<br>
existence of a straight and unterminated line of force may be assumed.<br>
<br>
A direction is predicated to lines of force corresponding with the<br>
direction of an electric current. They are assumed to start from a<br>
positively charged and to go towards a negatively charged surface. A<br>
positively charged body placed in an electrostatic field of force will<br>
be repelled from the region of positive into or towards the region of<br>
negative potential following the direction of the lines of force, not<br>
moving transversely to them, and having no transverse component in its<br>
motion.<br>
<br>
[Transcriber's note: More precisely, "A positively charged body placed<br>
in an electrostatic field of force will be repelled from the region of<br>
positive into or towards the region of negative potential ACCELERATING<br>
in the direction of the lines of force, not ACCELERATING transversely to<br>
them, and having no transverse component in its ACCELERATION."<br>
Previously acquired momentum can produce a transverse component of<br>
VELOCITY.]<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Electrostatics.</span><br>
The division of electric science treating of the phenomena of electric<br>
charge, or of electricity in repose, as contrasted with electro-dynamics<br>
or electricity in motion or in current form. Charges of like sign repel,<br>
and of unlike sign attract each other. The general inductive action is<br>
explained by the use of the electrostatic field of force and<br>
electrostatic lines of force, q. v. The force of attraction and<br>
repulsion of small bodies or virtual points, which are near enough to<br>
each other, vary as the square of the distance nearly, and with the<br>
product of the quantities of the charges of the two bodies.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Electrostatic Refraction.</span><br>
Dr. Kerr found that certain dielectrics exposed to electric strain by<br>
being placed between two oppositely excited poles of a Holtz machine or<br>
other source of very high tension possess double refracting powers, in<br>
other words can rotate a beam of polarized light, or can develop two<br>
complimentary beams from common light. Bisulphide of carbon shows the<br>
phenomenon well, acting as glass would if the glass were stretched in<br>
the direction of the electrostatic lines of force. To try it with glass,<br>
holes are drilled in a plate and wires from an influence machine are<br>
inserted therein. The discharge being maintained through the glass it<br>
polarizes light.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Electrostatic Series.</span><br>
A table of substances arranged in the order in which they are<br>
electrostatically charged by contact, generally by rubbing against each<br>
other. The following series is due to Faraday. The first members become<br>
positively excited when rubbed with any of the following members, and<br>
vice versa. The first elements correspond to the carbon plate in a<br>
galvanic battery, the succeeding elements to the zinc plate.<br>

irregularities. A feather lightly drawn over canvas is negatively<br>
electrified; if drawn through folds pressed against it it is positively<br>
excited. Many other exceptions exist, so that the table is of little<br>
value.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Electrotonus.</span><br>
An altered condition of functional activity occurring in a nerve<br>
subjected to the passage of an electric current. If the activity is<br>
decreased, which occurs near the anode, the state is one of<br>
anelectrotonus, if the activity is increased which occurs near the<br>

<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Electrotype.</span><br>
The reproduction of a form of type or of an engraving or of the like by<br>
electroplating, for printing purposes. The form of type is pressed upon<br>
a surface of wax contained in a shallow box. The wax is mixed with<br>
plumbago, and if necessary some more is dusted and brushed over its<br>
surface and some iron dust is sprinkled over it also. A matrix or<br>
impression of the type is thus obtained, on which copper is deposited by<br>
electroplating, q. v.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Element, Chemical.</span><br>
The original forms of matter that cannot be separated into constituents<br>
by any known process. They are about seventy in number. Some of the<br>
rarer ones are being added to or cancelled with the progress of chemical<br>
discovery. For their electric relations see Electro-chemical<br>
Equivalents--Electro-chemical Series.<br>
<br>
The elements in entering into combination satisfy chemical affinity and<br>
liberate energy, which may take the form of electric energy as in the<br>
galvanic battery, or of heat energy, as in the combustion of carbon or<br>
magnesium. Therefore an uncombined element is the seat of potential<br>
energy. (See Energy, Potential.) In combining the elements always<br>
combine in definite proportions. A series of numbers, one being proper<br>
to each element which denote the smallest common multipliers of these<br>
proportions, are called equivalents. Taking the theory of valency into<br>
consideration the product of the equivalents by the valencies gives the<br>
atomic weights.<br>

A method of determining the magnetic moment of a magnet. The magnet<br>
under examination, N S, is placed at right angles to the magnetic<br>
meridian, M O R, and pointing directly at or "end on" to the centre of a<br>
compass needle, n s. From the deflection a of the latter the moment is<br>
calculated.<br>

The inflowing current of electric osmose. (See Osmose, Electric.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">End Play.</span><br>
The power to move horizontally in its bearings sometimes given to<br>
armature shafts. This secures a more even wearing of the commutator<br>
faces. End play is not permissible in disc armatures, as the attraction<br>
of the field upon the face of the armature core would displace it<br>
endwise. For such armatures thrust-bearings preventing end play have to<br>
be provided.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Energy.</span><br>
The capacity for doing work. It is measured by work units which involve<br>
the exercise of force along a path of some length. A foot-pound,<br>
centimeter-gram, and centimeter-dyne are units of energy and work.<br>
<br>
The absolute unit of energy is the erg, a force of one dyne exercised<br>
over one centimeter of space. (See Dyne.)<br>
<br>
The dimensions of energy are<br>
&nbsp; force (M * L / T^2) * space (L) = M * (L^2 / T^2).<br>
Energy may be chemical (atomic or molecular), mechanical,<br>
electrical, thermal, physical, potential, kinetic, or actual, and other<br>
divisions could be formulated.<br>
<br>
<br>
239&nbsp;&nbsp; STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Energy, Atomic.</span><br>
The potential energy due to atomic relations set free by atomic change;<br>
a form of chemical energy, because chemistry refers to molecular as well<br>
as to atomic changes. When atomic energy loses the potential form it<br>
immediately manifests itself in some other form, such as heat or<br>
electric energy. It may be considered as always being potential energy.<br>
(See Energy, Chemical.)<br>
<br>
[Transcriber's note: This item refers to chemical energy, that is<br>
manifest in work done by electric forces during re-arrangement of<br>
electrons. Atomic energy now refers to re-arrangement of&nbsp; nucleons<br>
(protons and neutrons) and the resulting conversion of mass into<br>
energy.]<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Energy, Chemical.</span><br>
A form of potential energy (see Energy, Potential) possessed by elements<br>
in virtue of their power of combining with liberation of energy, as in<br>
the combination of carbon with oxygen in a furnace; or by compounds in<br>
virtue of their power of entering into other combinations more<br>
satisfying to the affinities of their respective elements or to their<br>
own molecular affinity. Thus in a galvanic couple water is decomposed<br>
with absorption of energy, but its oxygen combines with zinc with<br>
evolution of greater amount of energy, so that in a voltaic couple the<br>
net result is the setting free of chemical energy, which is at once<br>
converted into electrical energy in current form, if the battery is on a<br>
closed circuit.<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Energy, Conservation of.</span><br>
A doctrine accepted as true that the sum of energy in the universe is<br>
fixed and invariable. This precludes the possibility of perpetual<br>
motion. Energy may be unavailable to man, and in the universe the<br>
available energy is continually decreasing, but the total energy is the<br>
same and never changes.<br>
<br>
[Transcriber's note: If mass is counted a energy (E=m*(c^2)) then energy<br>
is strictly conserved.]<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Energy, Degradation of.</span><br>
The reduction of energy to forms in which it cannot be utilized by man.<br>
It involves the reduction of potential energy to kinetic energy, and the<br>
reduction of kinetic energy of different degrees to energy of the same<br>
degree. Thus when the whole universe shall have attained the same<br>
temperature its energy will have become degraded or non-available. At<br>
present in the sun we have a source of kinetic energy of high degree, in<br>
coal a source of potential energy. The burning of all the coal will be<br>
an example of the reduction of potential to kinetic energy, and the<br>
cooling of the sun will illustrate the lowering in degree of kinetic<br>
energy. (See Energy, Conservation of--Energy, Potential--Energy,<br>
Kinetic.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Energy, Electric.</span> <br>
The capacity for doing work possessed by electricity<br>
under proper conditions. Electric energy may be either kinetic or<br>
potential. As ordinary mechanical energy is a product of force and<br>
space, so electric energy is a product of potential difference and<br>
quantity. Thus a given number of coulombs of electricity in falling a<br>
given number of volts develop electric energy. The dimensions are found<br>
therefore by multiplying electric current intensity quantity<br>
&nbsp; ((M^.5) * (L^.5)),<br>
by electric potential<br>
&nbsp; ((M^.5)*(L^1.5) / (T^2)),<br>
giving (M * (L^2)/(T^2)),<br>
the dimensions of energy in general as it should be.<br>
<br>
The absolute unit of electric energy in electro-magnetic measure is<br>
(1E-7) volt coulombs.<br>
<br>
<br>
240&nbsp;&nbsp; STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.<br>
<br>
<br>
The practical unit is the volt-coulomb. As the volt is equal to 1E8<br>
absolute units of potential and the coulomb to 0.1 absolute units of<br>
quantity, the volt-coulomb is equal to 1E7 absolute units of energy.<br>
<br>
The volt-coulomb is very seldom used, and the unit of Electric Activity<br>
or Power (see Power, Electric), the volt-ampere, is universally used.<br>
This unit is sometimes called the Watt, q. v., and it indicates the rate<br>
of expenditure or of production of electric energy.<br>
<br>
The storing up in a static accumulator or condenser of a given charge of<br>
electricity, available for use with a given change of potential<br>
represents potential electric energy.<br>
<br>
The passing of a given quantity through a conductor with a given fall of<br>
potential represents kinetic electric energy.<br>
<br>
In a secondary battery there is no storage of energy, but the charging<br>
current simply accumulates potential chemical energy in the battery,<br>
which chemical energy is converted into electric energy in the discharge<br>
or delivery of the battery.<br>
<br>
It is customary to discuss Ohm's law in this connection; it is properly<br>
treated under Electric Power, to which the reader is referred. (See<br>
Power, Electric.)<br>
<br>
[Transcriber's note: A volt-ampere or watt is a unit of power. A<br>
volt-coulomb-second or watt-second is a unit of energy. Power
multiplied by<br>
time yields energy.]<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Energy, Electric Transmission of.</span><br>
If an electric current passes through a conductor all its energy is<br>
expended in the full circuit. Part of the circuit may be an electrical<br>
generator that supplies energy as fast as expended. Part of the circuit<br>
may be a motor which absorbs part of the energy, the rest being expended<br>
in forcing a current through the connecting wires and through the<br>
generator. The electric energy in the generator and connecting wires is<br>
uselessly expended by conversion into heat. That in the motor in great<br>
part is utilized by conversion into mechanical energy which can do<br>
useful work. This represents the transmission of energy. Every electric<br>
current system represents this operation, but the term is usually<br>
restricted to the transmission of comparatively large quantities of<br>
energy.<br>
<br>
A typical installation might be represented thus. At a waterfall a<br>
turbine water wheel is established which drives a dynamo. From the<br>
dynamo wires are carried to a distant factory, where a motor or several<br>
motors are established, which receive current from the dynamo and drive<br>
the machinery. The same current, if there is enough energy, may be used<br>
for running lamps or electroplating. As electric energy (see Energy,<br>
Electric,) is measured by the product of potential difference by<br>
quantity, a very small wire will suffice for the transmission of a small<br>
current at a high potential, giving a comparatively large quantity of<br>
energy. It is calculated that the energy of Niagara Falls could be<br>
transmitted through a circuit of iron telegraph wire a distance of over<br>
1,000 miles, but a potential difference of 135,000,000 volts would be<br>
required, something quite impossible to obtain or manage.<br>
<br>
[Transcriber's note: Contemporary long distance power transmission lines<br>
use 115,000 to 1,200,000 volts. At higher voltages corona discharges<br>
(arcing) create unacceptable losses.]<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Energy, Kinetic.</span><br>
Energy due to matter being actually in motion. It is sometimes called<br>
actual energy. The energy varies directly with the mass and with the<br>
square of the velocity. It is represented in formula by .5 *M * (v^2).<br>
<br>
Synonyms--Actual Energy--Energy of Motion--Dynamic Energy.<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Energy, Mechanical.</span><br>
The energy due to mechanical change or motion, virtually the same as<br>
molar energy. (See Energy, Molar.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Energy, Molar.</span><br>
The energy of masses of matter due to movements of or positions of<br>
matter in masses; such as the kinetic energy of a pound or of a ton in<br>
motion, or the potential energy of a pound at an elevation of one<br>
hundred feet.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Energy, Molecular.</span><br>
The potential energy due to the relations of molecules and set free by<br>
their change in the way of combination. It is potential for the same<br>
reason that applies to atomic and chemical energy, of which latter it is<br>
often a form, although it is often physical energy. The potential energy<br>
stored up in vaporization is physical and molecular energy; the<br>
potential energy stored up in uncombined potassium oxide and water, or<br>
calcium oxide (quicklime) and water is molecular, and when either two<br>
substances are brought together kinetic, thermal or heat energy is set<br>
free, as in slaking lime for mortar.<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Energy of an Electrified Body.</span><br>
An electrified body implies the other two elements of a condenser. It is<br>
the seat of energy set free when discharged. (See Dielectric, Energy<br>
of.) The two oppositely charged bodies tend to approach. This tendency,<br>
together with the distances separating them, represents a potential<br>
energy.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Energy of Stress.</span><br>
Potential energy due to stress, as the stretching of a spring. This is<br>
hardly a form of potential energy. A stressed spring is merely in a<br>
position to do work at the expense of its own thermal or kinetic energy<br>
because it is cooled in doing work. If it possessed true potential<br>
energy of stress it would not be so cooled.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Energy of Position.</span><br>
Potential energy due to position, as the potential energy of a pound<br>
weight raised ten feet (ten foot lbs.). (See Energy, Potential.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Energy, Physical.</span><br>
The potential energy stored up in physical position or set free in<br>
physical change. Thus a vapor or gas absorbs energy in its vaporization,<br>
which is potential energy, and appears as heat energy when the vapor<br>
liquefies.<br>
<br>
<br>
242&nbsp;&nbsp; STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Energy, Potential, or Static Energy.</span><br>
The capacity for doing work in a system due to advantage of position or<br>
other cause, such as the stress of a spring. A pound weight supported<br>
ten feet above a plane has ten foot lbs. of potential energy of position<br>
referred to that plane. A given weight of an elementary substance<br>
represents potential chemical energy, which will be liberated as actual<br>
energy in its combination with some other element for which it has an<br>
affinity. Thus a ton of coal represents a quantity of potential chemical<br>
energy which appears in the kinetic form of thermal energy when the coal<br>
is burning in a furnace. A charged Leyden jar represents a source of<br>
potential electric energy, which becomes kinetic heat energy as the same<br>
is discharged.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Energy, Thermal.</span><br>
A form of kinetic molecular energy due to the molecular motion of bodies<br>
caused by heat.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Entropy.</span><br>
Non-available energy. As energy may in some way or other be generally<br>
reduced to heat, it will be found that the equalizing of temperature,<br>
actual and potential, in a system, while it leaves the total energy<br>
unchanged, makes it all unavailable, because all work represents a fall<br>
in degree of energy or a fall in temperature. But in a system such as<br>
described no such fall could occur, therefore no work could be done. The<br>
universe is obviously tending in that direction. On the earth the<br>
exhaustion of coal is in the direction of degradation of its high<br>
potential energy, so that the entropy of the universe tends to zero.<br>
(See Energy, Degradation of.)<br>
<br>
[Transcriber's note: Entropy (disorder) INCREASES, while AVAILABLE<br>
ENERGY tends to zero.]<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Entropy, Electric.</span><br>
Clerk Maxwell thought it possible to recognize in the Peltier effect, q.<br>
v., a change in entropy, a gain or loss according to whether the<br>
thermo-electric junction was heated or cooled. This is termed Electric<br>
Entropy. (See Energy, Degradation of.)<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Equalizer.</span><br>
In electro-magnetic mechanism an arrangement for converting the pull of<br>
the electro-magnet varying in intensity greatly over its range of<br>
action, into a pull of sensibly equal strength throughout. The use of a<br>
rocking lever acting as a cam, with leverage varying as the armature<br>
approaches or recedes from the magnet core is one method of effecting<br>
the result. Such is shown in the cut. E is an electro-magnet, with<br>
armature a. A and B are the equalizer cams. The pull on the short end of<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Ether.</span><br>
The ether is a hypothetical thing that was invented to explain the<br>
phenomena of light. Light is theoretically due to transverse vibrations<br>
of the ether. Since the days of Young the conception of the ether has<br>
extended, and now light, "radiant heat," and electricity are all treated<br>
as phenomena of the ether. Electrical attraction and repulsion are<br>
explained by considering them due to local stresses in the ether;<br>
magnetic phenomena as due to local whirlpools therein. The ether was<br>
originally called the luminiferous ether, but the adjective should now<br>
be dropped. Its density is put at 936E-21 that of water, or equal to<br>
that of the atmosphere at 210 miles above the earth's surface. Its<br>
rigidity is about 1E-9 that of steel (see Ten, Powers of); as a whole it<br>
is comparable to an all-pervading jelly, with almost perfect elasticity.<br>
The most complete vacuum is filled with ether.<br>
<br>
All this is a hypothesis, for the ether has never been proved to exist.<br>
Whether gravitation will ever be explained by It remains to be seen.<br>
<br>
[Transcriber's note: The Michelson-Morley experiment in 1887 (five years<br>
before this book) cast serious doubt on the ether. In 1905 Einstein<br>
explained electromagnetic phenomenon with photons. In 1963 Edward M.<br>
Purcell used special relativity to derive the existence of magnetism and<br>
radiation.]<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Eudiometer.</span><br>
A graduated glass tube for measuring the volumes of gases. In its<br>
simplest form it is simply a cylindrical tube, with a scale etched or<br>
engraved upon it, closed at one end and open at the other. The gas to be<br>
measured is collected in it over a liquid, generally water, dilute<br>
sulphuric acid in the gas voltameter, or mercury. Many different shapes<br>
have been given them by Hoffmann, Ure, Bunsen and others.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Evaporation, Electric.</span><br>
The superficial sublimation or evaporation of a substance under the<br>
influence of negative electricity. It is one of the effects investigated<br>
by Crookes in his experiments with high vacua. He found that when a<br>
metal, even so infusible as platinum, was exposed to negative<br>
electrification in one of his high vacuum tubes, that it was volatilized<br>
perceptibly. A cadmium electrode heated and electrified negatively was<br>
found to give a strong coating of metal on the walls of the tube. Even<br>
in the open air the evaporation of water was found to be accelerated by<br>
negative electrification.<br>

The number expressing the proportional increase in size, either length,<br>
area or volume, of a substance under the influence generally of heat.<br>
There are three sets of coefficients, (1) of linear expansion, (2) of<br>
superficial expansion, (3) of cubic expansion or expansion of volume.<br>
The first and third are the only ones much used. They vary for different<br>
substances, and for the same substance at different temperatures. They<br>
are usually expressed as decimals indicating the mixed number referred<br>
to the length or volume of the body at the freezing point as unity.<br>
<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Explorer.</span><br>
A coil, similar to a magnetizing coil (see Coil, Magnetizing), used for<br>
investigating the electro-magnetic circuit and for similar purposes. If<br>
placed around an electro-magnet and connected with a galvanometer, it<br>
will produce a deflection, owing to a momentary induced current, upon<br>
any change in the magnet, such as removing or replacing the armature. It<br>
is useful in determining the leakage of lines of force and for general<br>
investigations of that nature. It is often called an exploring coil.<br>
Hughes' Induction Balance (see Induction Balance, Hughes') is sometimes<br>
called a Magnetic Explorer. The exploring coil may be put in circuit<br>
with a galvanometer for quantitative measurements or with a telephone<br>
for qualitative ones.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Extension Bell Call.</span><br>
A system of relay connection, q. v., by which a bell is made to continue<br>
ringing after the current has ceased coming over the main line. It is<br>
designed to prolong the alarm given by a magneto call bell, q. v., which<br>
latter only rings as long as the magneto handle is turned. A vibrating<br>
electric bell (see Bell, Electric,) is connected in circuit with a local<br>
battery and a switch normally open, but so constructed as to close the<br>
circuit when a current is passed and continue to do so indefinitely. The<br>
distant circuit is connected to this switch. When the magneto is worked<br>
it acts upon the switch, closes the local battery circuit and leaves it<br>
closed, while the bell goes on ringing until the battery is exhausted or<br>
the switch is opened by hand.<br>

<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Fahrenheit Scale.</span><br>
A thermometer scale in use in the United States and England. On this<br>
scale the temperature of melting ice is 32&deg;; that of condensing
steam is<br>
212&deg;; the degrees are all of equal length. Its use is indicated by
the<br>
letter F., as 180&deg; F. To convert its readings into centigrade,
subtract<br>
32 and multiply by 5/9. (b) To convert centigrade into F. multiply by<br>
9/5 and add 32. Thus 180&deg; F. = ((180-32) * 5/9)&deg; C. = 82.2&deg;
C. Again<br>
180&deg; C. = (180 * 9/5) + 32 = 324&deg; F.<br>
<br>
[Transcribers note: 180&deg; C. = (180 * 9/5) + 32 = 356&deg; F. ]<br>
<br>
The additions and subtractions must be algebraic in all cases. Thus when<br>
the degrees are minus or below zero the rules for conversion might be<br>
put thus: To convert degrees F. below zero into centigrade to the number<br>
of degrees F. add 32, multiply by 5/9 and place a minus sign (-) before<br>
it. (b) To convert degrees centigrade below zero into Fahrenheit,<br>
multiply the number of degrees by 9/5, subtract from 32 if smaller; if<br>
greater than 32 subtract 32 therefrom, and prefix a minus sign, thus:<br>
-10&deg; C. = 32 - (10 * 9/5) = 14&deg;. Again, -30&deg;C. = (30 * 9/5)
- 32 = 22 =<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Farad.</span><br>
The practical unit of electric capacity; the capacity of a conductor<br>
which can retain one coulomb of electricity at a potential of one volt.<br>
<br>
The quantity of electricity charged upon a conducting surface raises its<br>
potential; therefore a conductor of one farad capacity can hold two<br>
coulombs at two volts potential, and three coulombs at three volts, and<br>
so on. The electric capacity of a conductor, therefore, is relative<br>
compared to others as regards its charge, for the latter may be as great<br>
as compatible with absence of sparking and disruptive discharge. In<br>
other words, a one farad or two farad conductor may hold a great many<br>
coulombs. Charging a conductor with electricity is comparable to pumping<br>
air into a receiver. Such a vessel may hold one cubic foot of air at<br>
atmospheric pressure and two at two atmospheres, and yet be of one cubic<br>
foot capacity however much air is pumped into it.<br>
<br>
The farad is equal to one fundamental electrostatic unit of capacity<br>
multiplied by 9E11 and to one electro-magnetic unit multiplied by 1E-9.<br>
<br>
The farad although one of the practical units is far too large, so the<br>
micro-farad is used in its place. The capacity of a sphere the size of<br>
the earth is only .000636 of a farad.<br>
<br>
[Transcriber's note: Contemporary calculations give about .000720<br>
farad.]<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Faraday, Effect.</span><br>
The effect of rotation of its plane produced upon a polarized beam of<br>
light by passage through a magnetic field. (See Magnetic Rotary<br>
Polarization.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Faraday's Cube.</span><br>
To determine the surface action of a charge, Faraday constructed a room,<br>
twelve feet cube, insulated, and lined with tinfoil. This room he<br>
charged to a high potential, but within it he could detect no excitement<br>
whatever. The reason was because the electricity induced in the bodies<br>
within the room was exactly equal to the charge of the room-surface, and<br>
was bound exactly by it. The room is termed Faraday's cube.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Faraday's Dark Space.</span><br>
A non-luminous space between the negative and positive glows, produced<br>
in an incompletely exhausted tube through which a static discharge, as<br>
from an induction coil, is produced. It is perceptible in a rarefaction<br>
of 6 millimeters (.24 inch) and upwards. If the exhaustion is very high<br>
a dark space appears between the negative electrode and its discharge.<br>
This is known as Crookes' dark space.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Faraday's Disc.</span><br>
A disc of any metal, mounted so as to be susceptible of rotation in a<br>
magnetic field of force, with its axis parallel to the general direction<br>
of the lines of force. A spring bears against its periphery and another<br>
spring against its axle. When rotated, if the springs are connected by a<br>
conductor, a current is established through the circuit including the<br>
disc and conductor. The radius of the disc between the spring contacts<br>
represents a conductor cutting lines of force and generating a potential<br>
difference, producing a current. If a current is sent through the<br>
motionless wheel from centre to periphery it rotates, illustrating the<br>
doctrine of reversibility. As a motor it is called Barlow's or<br>
Sturgeon's Wheel. If the disc without connections is rapidly rotated it<br>
produces Foucault currents, q. v., within its mass, which resist its<br>
rotation and heat the disc.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Faraday's Net.</span><br>
An apparatus for showing that the electric charge resides on the<br>
surface. It consists of a net, conical in shape and rather deep, to<br>
whose apex two threads, one on each side, are attached. Its mouth is<br>
fastened to a vertical ring and the whole is mounted on an insulating<br>
support.<br>
<br>
It is pulled out to its full extent and is electrified. No charge can be<br>
detected inside it. By pulling one of the threads it is turned with the<br>
other side out. Now all the charge is found on the outside just as<br>
before, except that it is of course on the former inside surface of the<br>
bag. The interior shows no charge.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Faraday's Transformer.</span><br>
The first transformer. It was made by Michael Faraday. It was a ring of<br>
soft iron 7/8 inch thick, and 6 inches in external diameter. It was<br>
wound with bare wire, calico being used to prevent contact of the wire<br>
with the ring and of the layers of wire with each other, while twine was<br>
wound between the convolutions to prevent the wires from touching.<br>
Seventy-two feet of copper wire, 1/20 inch diameter, were wound in three<br>
superimposed coils, covering about one-half of the ring. On the other<br>
half sixty feet of copper wire were wound in two superimposed coils.<br>
Faraday connected his coils in different ways and used a galvanometer to<br>
measure the current produced by making and breaking one of the circuits<br>
used as a primary.<br>
<br>
The coil is of historic interest.<br>

Referring to induced currents, produced from induction coils. As Faraday<br>
was the original investigator of the phenomena of electro-magnetic<br>

phenomena and apparatus are often qualified by the adjective Faradic,<br>
especially in electro-therapeutics. A series of alternating<br>
electrostatic discharges, as from an influence machine (Holtz), are<br>
sometimes called Franklinic currents. They are virtually Faradic, except<br>
as regards their production.<br>

A lead in an electric central station distribution system, which lead<br>
runs from the station to some point in the district to supply current.<br>
It is not used for any side connections, but runs direct to the point<br>
where current is required, thus "feeding" the district directly. In the<br>
two wire system a feeder may be positive or negative; in the three wire<br>
system there is also a neutral feeder. Often the term feeder includes<br>
the group of two or of three parallel lines.<br>

This suspension, while the most delicate and reliable known, is very<br>

Polarity or direction being attributed to lines of force, if such<br>

may be of any kind, electro-magnetic or electrostatic. In one instance<br>
the latter is of interest. It is supposed to be produced by high<br>

the vicinity of the discharging terminals.<br>
<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Field Density.</span><br>
Field density or density of field is expressed in lines of force per<br>
unit area of cross-section perpendicular to the lines of force.<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Field, Distortion of.</span><br>
The lines of force reaching from pole to pole of an excited field magnet<br>
of a dynamo are normally symmetrical with respect to some axis and often<br>
with respect to several. They go across from pole to pole, sometimes<br>
bent out of their course by the armature core, but still symmetrical.<br>
The presence of a mass of iron in the space between the pole pieces<br>
concentrates the lines of force, but does not destroy the symmetry of<br>
the field.<br>
<br>
When the armature of the dynamo is rotated the field becomes distorted,<br>
and the lines of force are bent out of their natural shape. The new<br>
directions of the lines of force are a resultant of the lines of force<br>
of the armature proper and of the field magnet. For when the dynamo is<br>
started the armature itself becomes a magnet, and plays its part in<br>
forming the field. Owing to the lead of the brushes the polarity of the<br>
armature is not symmetrical with that of the field magnets. Hence the<br>
compound field shows distortion. In the cut is shown diagrammatically<br>
the distortion of field in a dynamo with a ring armature. The arrow<br>
denotes the direction of rotation, and n n * * * and s s * * * indicate<br>
points of north and south polarity respectively.<br>
<br>
<br>
253&nbsp; STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.<br>
<br>
<br>
The distorted lines must be regarded as resultants of the two induced<br>
polarities of the armature, one polarity due to the induction of the<br>
field, the other to the induction from its own windings. The positions<br>
of the brushes have much to do with determining the amount and degree of<br>
distortion. In the case of the ring armature it will be seen that some<br>
of the lines of force within the armature persist in their polarity and<br>
direction, almost as induced by the armature windings alone, and leak<br>
across without contributing their quota to the field. Two such lines are<br>
shown in dotted lines.<br>
<br>
In motors there is a similar but a reversed distortion.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Field, Drag of.</span><br>
When a conductor is moved through a field so that a current is generated<br>
in it, the field due to that current blends with the other field and<br>
with its lines of force, distorting the field, thereby producing a drag<br>
upon its own motion, because lines of force always tend to straighten<br>
themselves, and the straightening would represent cessation of motion in<br>
the conductor. This tendency to straightening therefore resists the<br>
motion of the conductor and acts a drag upon it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Field of Force.</span><br>
The space in the neighborhood of an attracting or repelling mass or<br>
system. Of electric fields of force there are two kinds, the<br>
Electrostatic and the Magnetic Fields of Force, both of which may be<br>
referred to. A field of force may be laid out as a collection of<br>
elements termed Lines of Force, and this nomenclature is universally<br>
adopted in electricity. The system of lines may be so constructed that<br>
(a) the work done in passing from one equipotential surface to the next<br>
is always the same; or (b) the lines of force are so laid out and<br>
distributed that at a place in which unit force is exercised there is a<br>
single line of force passing through the corresponding equipotential<br>
surface in each unit of area of that surface. The latter is the<br>
universal method in describing electric fields. It secures the following<br>
advantages:--First: The potential at any point in the field of space<br>
surrounding the attracting or repelling mass or masses is found by<br>
determining on which imaginary equipotential surface that point lies.<br>
Second: If unit length of a line of force cross n equipotential<br>
surfaces, the mean force along that line along the course of that part<br>
of it is equal to n units; for the difference of potential of the two<br>
ends of that part of the line of force = n; it is also equal to F s (F<br>
= force), because it represents numerically a certain amount of work;<br>
but s = I, whence n = F. Third: The force at any part of the field<br>
corresponds to the extent to which the lines of force are crowded<br>
together; and thence it may be determined by the number of lines of<br>
force which pass through a unit of area of the corresponding<br>
equipotential surface, that area being so chosen as to comprise the<br>
point in question. (Daniell.)<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Field of Force, Electrostatic.</span><br>

<br>
The existence of the field is easily shown by passing a conductor<br>
vertically through a horizontal card. On causing a current to go through<br>
the wire the field is formed, and iron filings dropped upon the card,<br>
tend, when the latter is gently tapped, to take the form of circles. The<br>
experiment gives a version of the well-known magnetic figures, q. v. See<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Field, Pulsatory.</span><br>
A field produced by pulsatory currents. By induction such field can<br>
produce an alternating current.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Field, Rotating.</span><br>
In a dynamo the field magnets are sometimes rotated instead of the<br>
armature, the latter being stationary. In Mordey's alternator the<br>
armature, nearly cylindrical, surrounds the field, and the latter<br>
rotates within it, the arrangement being nearly the exact reverse of the<br>
ordinary one. This produces a rotating field.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Field, Rotatory.</span><br>
A magnetic field whose virtual poles keep rotating around its centre of<br>
figure. If two alternating currents differing one quarter period in<br>
phase are carried around four magnetizing coils placed and connected in<br>
sets of two on the same diameter and at right angles to each other, the<br>
polarity of the system will be a resultant of the combination of their<br>
polarity, and the resultant poles will travel round and round in a<br>
circle. In such a field, owing to eddy currents, masses of metal,<br>
journaled like an armature, will rotate, with the speed of rotation of<br>
the field.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Figure of Merit.</span><br>
In the case of a galvanometer, a coefficient expressing its delicacy. It<br>
is the reciprocal of the current required to deflect the needle through<br>
one degree. By using the reciprocal the smaller the current required the<br>
larger is the figure of merit. The same term may be applied to other<br>
instruments.<br>
<br>
It is often defined as the resistance of a circuit through which one<br>
Daniell's element will produce a deflection of one degree on the scale<br>
of the instrument. The circuit includes a Daniell's cell of resistance<br>
r, a rheostat R, galvanometer G and shunt S. Assume that with the shunt<br>
in parallel a deflection of a divisions is obtained. The resistance of<br>
the shunted galvanometer is (GS/G+S ; the multiplying power m of the<br>
shunt is S+G/S; the formula or figure of merit is m d (r+R +G S/G+S).<br>
<br>
The figure of merit is larger as the instrument is more sensitive.<br>

A thin long piece of a solid substance. In general it is so thin as to<br>
act almost like a thread, to be capable of standing considerable<br>
flexure. The distinction between filament and rod has been of much<br>
importance in some patent cases concerning incandescent lamps. As used<br>
by electricians the term generally applies to the carbon filament of<br>
incandescent lamps. This as now made has not necessarily any fibres, but<br>
is entitled to the name of filament, partly by convention, partly by its<br>
relative thinness and want of stiffness. (See Incandescent<br>

houses in a city or district. It includes alarm boxes, distributed at<br>
frequent intervals, locked, with the place where the key is kept<br>
designated, or in some systems left unlocked. On opening the door of the<br>
box and pulling the handle or otherwise operating the alarm, a<br>
designated signal is sent to the central station. From this it is<br>
telegraphed by apparatus worked by the central station operator to the<br>
engine houses. The engines respond according to the discipline of the<br>

a generator, to which the term flashing is applied.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Flashing of Incandescent Lamp Carbons.</span><br>
A process of treatment for the filaments of incandescent lamps. The<br>
chamber before sealing up is filled with a hydro-carbon vapor or gas,<br>
such as the vapor of a very light naphtha (rhigolene). A current is then<br>
passed through the filament heating it to redness. The more attenuated<br>
parts or those of highest resistance are heated the highest, and<br>
decompose most rapidly the hydro-carbon vapor, graphitic carbon being<br>
deposited upon these parts, while hydrogen is set free. This goes on<br>
until the filament is of uniform resistance throughout. It gives also a<br>
way of making the resistance of the filament equal to any desired number<br>
of ohms, provided it is originally of high enough resistance. The<br>
process increases the conductivity of the filament.<br>
<br>
After flashing the chambers are pumped out and sealed up.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Flashing Over.</span><br>
A phenomenon observed in high potential dynamos. On a sudden alteration<br>
of the resistance of the circuit a long blue spark will be drawn out<br>
around the surface of the commutator from brush to brush. The spark is<br>
somewhat of the nature of an arc, and may seriously injure commutators<br>
whose sections are only separated by mica, or other thin insulation. In<br>
the case of commutators whose sections are separated by air spaces it is<br>
not so injurious.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Flats.</span><br>
In a commutator of a dynamo, the burning or wearing away of a commutator<br>
segment to a lower level than the rest. Sometimes two adjacent bars will<br>
be thus affected, causing a flat place on the commutator. It is not<br>
always easy to account for the formation of flats. They may have their<br>
origin in periodic vibrations due to bad mounting, or to sparking at the<br>
particular point.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Floor Push.</span><br>
A press or push button constructed to be set into the floor to be<br>
operated by pressing with the foot. It is used to ring an alarm bell,<br>
sound a buzzer or for similar service.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Fluid, Depolarizing.</span><br>
A fluid used in voltaic batteries to dispose of the hydrogen, which goes<br>
to the negative plate. This it does by oxidizing it. Chromic acid,<br>
nitric acid, and chloric acids are among the constituents of liquid<br>
depolarizers. (See Electropoion Fluid.)<br>

revolves by reaction. The tension of its charge is highest at the<br>
points, the air there is highly electrified and repelled, the reaction<br>
pushing the wheel around like a Barker's mill or Hero's steam engine.<br>

When several forces act in a different direction upon a point they may<br>
be drawn or graphically represented as arrows or lines emanating from<br>
the point in the proper direction and of lengths proportional to the<br>
force they exercise. Any two can be treated as contiguous sides of a<br>

called the resultant, will represent the combined action of the two<br>
forces, both as regards direction and intensity. This is the composition<br>
of two forces.<br>

If more than two forces act upon the given point the resultant can be<br>
composed with any of the others and a new force developed. The new<br>
resultant can be combined with another force, and the process kept up,<br>
eliminating the components one by one until a final resultant of all is<br>
obtained. This will give the exact direction and intensity of the<br>

A classic experiment in electricity, leading to the discovery of current<br>
or dynamic electricity. If a pair of legs of a recently killed frog are<br>
prepared with the lumbar nerves exposed near the base of the spinal<br>
column, and if a metallic conductor, one half-length zinc and the other<br>
half-length copper, is held, one end between the lumbar nerves and the<br>
spine, and the other end against one of the muscles of the thigh or<br>
lower legs, the moment contact occurs and the circuit is completed<br>
through the animal substance the muscles contract and the leg is<br>
violently drawn upwards. Galvani, in 1786, first performed, by accident,<br>
this famous experiment, it is said, with a scalpel with which he was<br>
dissecting the animal. He gave his attention to the nerves and muscles.<br>
Volta, more happily, gave his attention to the metals and invented the<br>

A fuse for igniting an explosive by electricity. There are two kinds. In<br>
one a thin wire unites the ends of the two conducting wires as they<br>
enter the case of the fuse. The larger wires are secured to the case, so<br>
that no strain comes on the fine wire. On passing a current of<br>
sufficient strength the small wire is heated. In use the fuse is bedded<br>
in powder, which again may be surrounded by fulminating powder, all<br>
contained in a copper or other metallic case. Such a detonator is used<br>
for exploding guncotton and other high explosives.<br>
<br>
The other kind of fuse is similar, but has no thin connecting wire. The<br>
ends of the conductors are brought nearer together without touching. In<br>
use a static discharge is produced across from end to end of the<br>
conductors, igniting a proper explosive placed there as in the other<br>
case.<br>
<br>
The first kind of fuse is generally operated by a battery or small<br>
mechanical generator--the latter by a spark coil, frictional or<br>

An instrument for measuring current strength and sometimes for measuring<br>
inferentially potential difference, depending on the action of a<br>
magnetic field established by the current, such action being exerted on<br>
a magnetic needle or its equivalent.<br>
<br>
A current passing through a conductor establishes circular lines of<br>
force. A magnetic needle placed in their field is acted on and tends to<br>
place itself parallel with the lines, in accordance with the principles<br>
of current induction. (See Induction, Electro-magnetic.) A common<br>
compass held near a conductor through which a current is passing tends<br>
to place itself at right angles to such conductor. For a maximum effect<br>
the conductor or the part nearest the needle should lie in the magnetic<br>
meridian. If at right angles thereto its action will only strengthen the<br>
directive force of the earth's induction or magnetic field, as the<br>
needle naturally points north and south. Such combination is virtually a<br>
galvanometer.<br>
<br>
<br>
266&nbsp;&nbsp; STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.<br>
<br>
<br>
A typical galvanometer comprises a flat coil of wire placed horizontally<br>
within which a magnetic needle is delicately poised, so as to be free to<br>
rotate with the least possible friction. The needle may be supported on<br>
a sharp point like a compass needle, or may be suspended by a long fine<br>
filament. It should be covered by a glass plate and box, or by a glass<br>
shade. Finally a graduated disc may be arranged to show the amount of<br>
deflection of the needle.<br>
<br>
In use the apparatus is turned about until the needle, as acted on by<br>
the earth's magnetic field, lies parallel to the direction of the coils<br>
of wire. On passing a current through the coil the needle is deflected,<br>
more or less, according to its strength.<br>
<br>
By using exceedingly fine wire, long enough to give high resistance, the<br>
instrument can be used for very high potentials, or is in condition for<br>
use in determining voltage. By using a coil of large wire and low<br>
resistance it can be employed in determining amperage. In either case<br>
the deflection is produced by the current.<br>
<br>
The needle is often placed above or below the coil so as only to receive<br>
a portion of its effect, enough for all practical purposes in the<br>
commoner class of instruments.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Galvanometer, Aperiodic.</span><br>
A galvanometer whose needle is damped (see Damping) as, for instance, by<br>
the proximity of a plate of metal, by an air vane or otherwise, so that<br>
it reaches its reading with hardly any oscillation. A very light needle<br>
and a strong magnetic field also conduce to vibrations of short period<br>
dying out very quickly. Such galvanometers are termed "dead-beat." No<br>
instrument is absolutely dead-beat, only relatively so.<br>

needle has its own coil, the coils being wound in opposite directions so<br>
as to unite in producing deflections in the same sense. As there should<br>

Fig. 179. SIEMENS &amp; HALSKE'S GALVANOMETER.<br>
<br>
<br>
Siemens &amp; Halske's galvanometer is of the reflecting or mirror type
(see<br>
Galvanometer, Reflecting) with suspended, bell-shaped magnet, in place<br>
of the ordinary magnetic needle, or astatic combination of the lightest<br>
possible weight in the regular instrument. A copper ball drilled out to<br>
admit the magnet is used as damper in the ordinary use of the<br>
instrument. To convert it into a ballistic galvanometer the copper ball<br>
is removed. The heavy suspended magnet then by its inertia introduces<br>
the desired element into the instrument.<br>
<br>
<br>
268&nbsp;&nbsp; STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.<br>
<br>
<br>
Referring to the cut, Fig. 179, M is the suspended magnet, with north<br>
and south poles n and s; S is the reflecting mirror; r is the tube<br>
containing the suspending thread; R is the damper removed for ballistic<br>
work.<br>
<br>
The ballistic galvanometer is used to measure quantities of electricity<br>
in an instantaneous discharge, which discharge should be completed<br>
before the heavy needle begins to move. The extreme elongation or throw<br>
of the needle is observed, and depends (1) on the number of coulombs (K)<br>
that pass during the discharge; (2) on the moment of inertia of the<br>
needle and attached parts; (3) on the moment of the controlling forces,<br>
i. e., the forces tending to pull the needle back to zero; (4) on the<br>
moment of the damping forces; (5) on the moment of the deflecting forces<br>
due to a given constant current. The formula is thus expressed:<br>
<br>
K = (P / PI ) * A * sin( k&ordm; / 2 ) / tan( a&ordm; )<br>
<br>
in which K = coulombs discharged; P = periodic time of vibration of<br>
needle; A = amperes producing a steady deflection equal to&nbsp;
a&ordm;&nbsp; ; k&ordm; =<br>
first angular deflection of needle. For accuracy k&ordm; and a&ordm;
should both<br>
be small and the damping so slight as to be negligible. Otherwise a<br>
correction for the latter must be applied. For approximate work for
k&ordm;<br>
and a&ordm; the deflections read on the scale may be used with the
following<br>
formula:<br>
<br>
K = (P / PI ) * ( A / 2 ) * ( k&ordm; / a&ordm; )<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Galvanometer Constant.</span><br>
Assume a galvanometer with a very short needle and so placed with<br>
respect to its coils that the magnetic field produced by a current<br>
circulating in them is sensibly uniform in the neighborhood of the<br>
needle, with its lines of force at right angles thereto. The field is<br>
proportional to the current i, so that it may be denoted by G i. Then G<br>
is the galvanometer constant. If now the angle of deflection of the<br>
needle is ? against the earth's field H, M being the magnetic moment of<br>
the needle we have G i M cos ? = H M sin ? or i = (H/G)* tan ?. H/G is<br>
the reduction factor; variable as H varies for different places.<br>
<br>
For a tangent galvanometer the constant G is equal to&nbsp; 2*PI*(n/a),
in<br>
which n denotes the number of turns of wire, and a denotes the radius of<br>
the circle.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Galvanometer, Differential.</span><br>
A galvanometer in which the needle is acted on by two coils wound in<br>
opposition, each of equal deflecting action and of equal resistance. If<br>
a current is divided between two branches or parallel conductors, each<br>
including one of the coils, when the needle points to zero the<br>
resistances of the two branches will bc equal. In the cut, C C'<br>

Q, is divided.<br>

A galvanometer the deflections of whose needle are read by an image<br>
projected by light reflected from a mirror attached to the needle or to<br>
a vertical wire carrying the needle. A lamp is placed in front of the<br>
instrument facing the mirror. The light of the lamp is reflected by the<br>
mirror upon a horizontal scale above the lamp. An image of a slit or of<br>
a wire may be caused thus to fall upon the scale, the mirror being<br>
slightly convex, or a lens being used to produce the projection.<br>
<br>
<br>
271&nbsp; STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.<br>
<br>
<br>
If the mirror swings through a horizontal arc, the reflected image will<br>
move, in virtue of a simple geometrical principle, through an arc of<br>
twice as many degrees. The scale can be placed far from the mirror, so<br>
that the ray of light will represent a weightless index of very great<br>
length, and minute deflections of the needle will be shown distinctly<br>
upon the scale.<br>
<br>
In the cut, Fig. 182, the ray of light from the lamp passes through the<br>
aperture, m m, and is made parallel by the lens, L. At s is the mirror<br>
attached to the needle and moving with it. A scale placed at t receives<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Galvanometer, Sine.</span><br>
A galvanometer whose measurements depend upon the sine of the angle of<br>
deflection produced when the coil and needle lie in the same vertical<br>
plane.<br>
<br>
The needle, which may be a long one, is surrounded by a coil, which can<br>
be rotated about a vertical axis passing through the point of suspension<br>
of the needle. Starting with the needle at rest in the plane of the<br>
coil, a current is passed through the coil deflecting the needle, the<br>
coil is swung around deflecting the needle still more, until the needle<br>
lies in the plane of the coil; the intensity of the current will then be<br>
in proportion to the sine of the angle through which the coil and needle<br>
move.<br>
<br>
In the galvanometer M is a circle carrying the coil, N is a scale over<br>
which the needles, m and n, move, the former being a magnetic needle,<br>
the latter an index at right angles and attached thereto; a and b are<br>
wires carrying the current to be measured. The circles, M and N, are<br>
carried by a base, O, around which they rotate. H is a fixed horizontal<br>
graduated circle. In use the circle, M, is placed in the magnetic<br>
meridian, the current is passed through the coil, M; the needle is<br>
deflected; M is turned until its plane coincides with the direction of<br>
the needle, m. The current strength is proportional to the sine of the<br>
angle of deflection. This angle is measured by the vernier, C, on the<br>
circle, H. The knob, A, is used to turn the circle, M.<br>

that of the earth;<br>
<br>
(2) the diameter of the coil must be large compared to the length of the<br>
needle;<br>
<br>
(3) the centre of suspension of the needle must be at the centre of the<br>
coil;<br>
<br>
(4) the magnetic axis of the needle must lie in the plane of the coil<br>
when no current is passing.<br>
<br>
If a single current strength is to be measured the best results will be<br>
attained when the deflection is 45&deg;; in comparing two currents the
best<br>
results will be attained when the deflections as nearly as possible are<br>
at equal distances on both sides of 45&deg;.<br>
<br>
The needle should not exceed in length one-tenth the diameter of the<br>
coil.<br>
<br>
For very small deflections any galvanometer follows the law of<br>
tangential deflection.<br>
<br>
As for very small deflections the tangents are practically equal to the<br>
arcs subtended, for such deflections the currents are proportional to<br>
the deflections they produce.<br>
<br>
The sensibility is directly proportional to the number of convolutions<br>
of wire and inversely proportional to their diameter.<br>
<br>
The tangent law is most accurately fulfilled when the depth of the coil<br>
in the radial direction is to the breadth in the axial direction as<br>
squareRoot(3):squareRoot(2), or about as 11:9.<br>

<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Galvanometer, Torsion.</span><br>
A galvanometer whose needle is suspended by a long filament or by a<br>
thread and spiral spring against whose force of torsion the movements of<br>
the needle are produced. The current strength is determined by bringing<br>
the needle back to its position of rest by turning a hand-button or<br>
other arrangement. The angle through which this is turned gives the<br>
angle of torsion. From this the current strength is calculated on the<br>
general basis that it is proportional to the angle of torsion.<br>

A galvanometer of Sir William Thomson's invention embodying the tangent
<br>
principle, and having its sensibility adjustable by moving the magnetic
<br>
needle horizontally along a scale (the "meter") towards or away from
the <br>
coil. A curved magnet is used to adjust the control. The leads are <br>
twisted to prevent induction.<br>
<br>
The instrument is made with a high resistance coil for voltage<br>
determinations, and with a low resistance coil for amperage<br>
determinations.<br>
<br>
At one end of a long base board a vertical coil with its plane at right<br>
angles to the axis of the board is mounted. A scale (the "meter" of the<br>
name) runs down the centre of the board. A groove also runs down the<br>
centre. The magnetic needle is contained in a quadrant-shaped<br>
glass-covered box which slides up and down the groove. A number of short<br>
parallel needles mounted together, with an aluminum pointer are used.<br>

A goblet lined for half its interior surface with tinfoil. It is placed<br>
in the receiver of an air pump from the top of whose bell a conductor<br>
descends into it, not touching the foil. On producing a good<br>
rarefaction, and discharging high tension electricity from between the<br>

A name suggested for unit intensity of magnetic field. Sylvanus P.<br>
Thomson proposed for its value the intensity of a field of 1E8 C. G. S.<br>
electro-magnetic units. J. A. Fleming proposed the strength of field<br>
which would develop one volt potential difference in a wire 1E6<br>
centimeters long, moving through such field with a velocity of one<br>
centimeter per second. This is one hundred times greater than Thomson's<br>
standard. Sir William Thomson suggested the intensity of field produced<br>
by a current of one ampere at a distance of one centimeter<br>

The gauss is not used to any extent; practical calculations are based on<br>
electro-magnetic lines of force.<br>

Sealed tubes of glass containing highly rarefied gases, and provided<br>
with platinum electrodes extending through the glass tightly sealed as<br>
they pass through it, and often extending a short distance beyond its<br>
interior surface.<br>
<br>
On passing through them the static discharge luminous effects are<br>
produced varying with the degree of exhaustion, the contents (gas), the<br>
glass itself, or solutions surrounding it. The two latter conditions<br>
involve fluorescence phenomena often of a very beautiful description.<br>

The pressure of the gas is less than one-half of a millimeter of<br>
mercury. If a complete vacuum is produced the discharge will not pass.<br>
If too high rarefaction is produced radiant matter phenomena (see<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Gold Stripping Bath</span>.<br>
A bath for removing gold from plated articles without dissolving the<br>
base in order to save the precious metal. A bath of 10 parts of<br>
potassium cyanide and 100 parts of water may be used, the articles to be<br>
stripped being immersed therein as the anode of an active circuit. If<br>
the gilding is on a silver or copper basis, or on an alloy of these<br>
metals the same solution attacks the base and dissolves it, which is<br>
objectionable. For silver articles it is enough to heat to cherry red<br>
and throw into dilute sulphuric acid. The gold scales off in metallic<br>
spangles. For copper articles, a mixture of 10 volumes concentrated<br>
sulphuric acid, 1 volume nitric acid, and 2 volumes hydrochloric acid<br>
may be used by immersion only, or with a battery. The sulphuric acid in<br>
such large excess is supposed to protect the copper. For copper articles<br>
concentrated sulphuric acid alone with the battery may be used. This<br>
does not sensibly attack the copper if it is not allowed to become<br>
diluted. Even the dampness of the air may act to dilute it.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Graduator.</span><br>
Apparatus for enabling the same line to be used for telegraph signals<br>

One type consists in coils with iron cores or simply electromagnets.<br>
These act to retard the current in reaching its full power and also<br>
prolong it. This gives a graduated effect to the signals, so that the<br>
telephone diaphragm is not audibly affected by the impulses.<br>

The telephoning current is so slight and so rapid in its characteristic<br>
changes that it is without effect upon the ordinary telegraph.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Gram. </span><br>
The unit of weight in the metric system; accepted as the unit of<br>
mass in the absolute of C. G. S. system of units. It is the<br>
one-thousandth part of mass of a standard weight preserved under proper<br>
conditions in Paris, and supposed to be the mass of a cubic decimeter of<br>
distilled water at the temperature of the maximum density of water. The<br>
standard is the kilogram; the temperature is 3.9&ordm; C. (39&ordm;
F.). The<br>
standard kilogram is found to be not exactly the weight of a cubic<br>
decimeter of water, the latter weighing 1.000013 kilogram.<br>
<br>
If therefore the defined gram on the water basis is taken as the unit it<br>
varies very slightly from the accepted gram.<br>
<br>
1 gram is equal to 15.43234874 grains. (Prof. W. H. Miller.)<br>

The number of grams of an element equal numerically to the atomic<br>
weight, as 16 grams of oxygen, 1 gram of hydrogen, 35.5 grams of<br>
chlorine; all which might be expressed as gram-atoms of oxygen, hydrogen<br>
and chlorine respectively.<br>
<br>
The gram-atom approximately expresses the number of gram-calories<br>
required to heat one gram of the substance 1&ordm; C. (1.8&ordm; F.).
This is in<br>
virtue of Dulong and Petit's discovery that the atomic weight of an<br>
element multiplied by its specific heat gives approximately a constant<br>
for all elements.<br>
<br>
[Transcriber's note: A gram-atom is the mass, in grams, of one mole of<br>

The velocity imparted to a body in one second by the action of<br>
gravitation at any standard point upon the earth's surface in a vacuum.<br>

A cross of thin metal, such as gold leaf, is secured upon a pane of<br>

To the other two arms a galvanometer is connected in circuit. If the<br>
cross is put into a field of force whose lines are perpendicular<br>
thereto, the galvanometer will disclose a constant current. The current<br>
is pushed, as it were, into the galvanometer circuit. Other metals have<br>
been used with similar results. They must be thin or the experiment<br>
fails. If the arm receiving the battery current is horizontal, and if it<br>
flows from left to right, and if the lines of force go from downward<br>
through the cross, the current in the galvanometer circuit will flow<br>
from the observer through the other arms of the cross, if the cross is<br>
of gold, silver, platinum or tin, and the reverse if of iron. The<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Heat.</span><br>
A form of kinetic energy, due to a confused oscillatory movement of the<br>
molecules of a body. Heat is not motion, as a heated body does not<br>
change its place; it is not momentum, but it is the energy of motion. If<br>
the quantity of molecular motion is doubled the momentum of the<br>
molecules is also doubled, but the molecular mechanical energy or heat<br>
is quadrupled.<br>
<br>
As a form of energy it is measured by thermal units. The calorie is the<br>
most important, and unfortunately the same term applies to two units,<br>
the gram-degree C. and the kilogram-degree C. (See Calorie.) Calories<br>
are determined by a calorimeter, q. v.<br>
<br>
Independent of quantity of heat a body may be hotter or colder.<br>
Thermometers are used to determine its temperature.<br>
<br>
Heat is transmitted by conduction, a body conducting it slowly for some<br>
distance through its own substance. Bodies vary greatly in their<br>
conductivity for heat. It is also transmitted by convection of gases or<br>
liquids, when the heated molecules traveling through the mass impart<br>
their heat to other parts. Finally it is transmitted by ether waves with<br>
probably the speed of light. This mode of transmission and the phenomena<br>
of it were attributed to radiant heat. As a scientific term this is now<br>
dropped by many scientists. This practice very properly restricts the<br>
term "heat" to kinetic molecular motion.<br>
<br>
The mechanical equivalent of heat is the number of units of work which<br>
the energy of one unit quantity of heat represents. (See Equivalents,<br>
Mechanical and Physical.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Heat, Atomic.</span><br>
The product of the specific heat of an element by its atomic weight. The<br>
product is approximately the same for all the elements, and varies as<br>
determined between 5.39 and 6.87. The variations are by some attributed<br>
principally to imperfection of the work in determining them. The atomic<br>
heat represents the number of gram calories required to raise the<br>
temperature of a gram atom (a number of grams equal numerically to the<br>
atomic weight) one degree centigrade.<br>
<br>
<br>
286&nbsp;&nbsp; STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Heat, Electric.</span><br>
This term has been given to the heat produced by the passage of a<br>
current of electricity through a conductor. It is really electrically<br>
produced heat, the above term being a misnomer.<br>
<br>
The rise of temperature produced in a cylindrical conductor by a current<br>
depends upon the diameter of the conductor and on the current. The<br>
length of the wire has only the indirect connection that the current<br>
will depend upon the resistance and consequently upon its length.<br>
<br>
The quantity of heat produced in a conductor by a current is in<br>
gram-degree C. units equal to the product of the current, by the<br>
electro-motive force or potential difference maintained between the ends<br>
of the wire, by .24.<br>
<br>
The cube of the diameter of a wire for a given rise of temperature<br>
produced in such conductor by a current is equal approximately to the<br>
product of the square of the current, by the specific resistance (q. v.)<br>
of the material of the conductor, by .000391, the whole divided by the<br>
desired temperature in centigrade units.<br>

A term applied to the phenomena included under the Thomson effect, q.<br>
v., the unequal or differential heating effect produced by a current of<br>
electricity in conductors whose different parts are maintained at<br>
different temperatures.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Heater, Electric.</span><br>
An apparatus for converting electrical energy into thermal energy.<br>
<br>
An incandescent lamp represents the principle, and in the Edison meter<br>
has been used as such to maintain the temperature of the solutions.<br>
Heaters for warming water and other purposes have been constructed,<br>
utilizing conductors heated by the passage of the current as a source of<br>
heat. (See also Heating Magnet.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Heating Error.</span><br>
In voltmeters the error due to alteration of resistance of the coil by<br>
heating. If too strong a current is sent through the instrument, the<br>
coils become heated and their resistance increased. They then do not<br>
pass as much current as they should for the potential difference to<br>
which they may be exposed. Their readings then will be too low. One way<br>
of avoiding the trouble is to have a key in circuit, and to pass only an<br>
instantaneous or very brief current through the instrument and thus get<br>
the reading before the coils have time to heat.<br>
<br>
The heating error does not exist for ammeters, as they are constructed<br>
to receive the entire current, and any heating "error" within their<br>
range is allowed for in the dividing of the scale.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Heating Magnet.</span><br>
An electro-magnet designed to be heated by Foucault currents induced in<br>
its core by varying currents in the windings. It has been proposed as a<br>
source of artificial heat, a species of electric heating apparatus for<br>
warming water, or other purposes.<br>

The heat produced by an electric current in a conductor of identical<br>

the absence of the Thomson effect, q. v.) or Peltier effect, q. v.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Heat, Mechanical Equivalent of.</span><br>
The mechanical energy corresponding to a given quantity of heat energy.<br>
Mechanical energy is generally represented by some unit of weight and<br>
height, such as the foot-pound; and heat energy is represented by a<br>
given weight of water heated a given amount, such as a pound-degree<br>
centigrade. Joule's equivalent is usually accepted; it states that<br>
772.55 foot pounds of mechanical energy are equivalent to 1 pound-degree<br>
F. (one pound avds. of water raised in temperature one degree<br>
Fahrenheit). Other equivalencies have also been deduced.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Heat, Molecular.</span><br>
The product of a specific heat of the compound by its molecular weight.<br>
It is approximately equal to the sum of the atomic heats of its<br>
constituent elements.<br>
<br>
The molecular heat represents the number of gram calories required to<br>
raise the temperature of a gram-molecule (a number of grams equal<br>
numerically to the molecular weight) one degree centigrade.<br>
<br>
The molecular heat is approximately equal for all substances.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Heat, Specific.</span><br>
The capacity of a body for heat; a coefficient representing the relative<br>
quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of an identical<br>
weight of a given body a defined and identical amount.<br>
<br>
The standard of comparison is water; its specific heat is taken as<br>
unity. The specific heats by weight of other substances are less than<br>
unity. The specific heat varies with the temperature. Thus the specific<br>
heat of water is more strictly 1+.00015 t&ordm; C.<br>
<br>
Specific heat is greater when a substance is in the liquid than when it<br>
is in the solid state. Thus the specific heat of ice is 0.489; less<br>
than half that of water. It differs with the allotropic modifications of<br>
bodies; the specific heat of graphite is .202; of diamond, .147.<br>
<br>
The product of the specific heat by the atomic weight of elements gives<br>
a figure approximately the same. A similar law applies in the case of<br>
molecules. (See Heat, Atomic-Heat, Molecular.)<br>
<br>
The true specific heat of a substance should be separated from the heat<br>
expended in expanding a body against molecular and atomic forces, and<br>
against the atmospheric pressure. So far this separation has not been<br>
possible to introduce in any calculations.<br>

A proposed term to account for the heat absorbed or given out in<br>
unhomogeneous conductors, by the Thomson effect, or Peltier effect (see<br>
Effect, Thomson--Effect, Peltier.) If a current of electricity be<br>
assumed to exist, then under the action of these effects it may be<br>
regarded as absorbing or giving out so many coulombs of heat, and thus<br>
establishing a basis for specific heat.<br>

33&deg; F.<br>
<br>
The C. G. S. unit is the gram-degree C.; another metric unit is the<br>
kilogram-degree C. The latter is the calorie; the former is sometimes<br>
called the small calorie or the joule; the latter is sometimes called<br>
the large calorie. The term joule is also applied to a quantity of heat<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Heterostatic Method.</span><br>
A method of using the absolute or attracted disc electrometer. (See<br>
Electrometer Absolute.) The formula for its idiostatic use, q. v.,<br>
involves the determination of d, the distance between the suspended and<br>
fixed discs. As this is difficult to determine the suspended disc and<br>
guard ring may be kept at one potential and the lower fixed disc is then<br>
connected successively with the two points whose potential difference is<br>
to be determined. Their difference is determined by the difference<br>
between d and d', the two distances between the discs. This difference<br>
is the distance through which the micrometer screw is moved. The<br>
heterostatic formula is:<br>
<br>
V' - V = (d' - d)* squareRoot( 8*PI*F / S )<br>
<br>
in which V and V' are potentials of the two points; d' and d the two<br>
distances between the discs necessary for equilibrium; S the area of the<br>
disc and F the force of attraction in dynes. (See Idiostatic Method.)<br>

H. P. is the abbreviation for horse power. (See Horse Power, Electric.)<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Horse Power, Actual.</span><br>
The rate of activity of a machine, as actually developed in condition<br>
for use. It is less than the indicated or total horse power, because<br>
diminished by the hurtful resistances of friction, and other sources of<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Horse Power, Electric.</span><br>
The equivalent of a mechanical horse power in electric units, generally<br>
in volt-amperes or watts; 745.943 watts are equivalent to the activity<br>
of one British horse power; 735.75 are equivalent to one metric horse<br>
power. The number 746 is usually taken in practical calculations to give<br>
the equivalency.<br>

Fig. 198. HUGHES' INDUCTION BALANCE.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Hughes' Induction Balance.</span><br>
An apparatus for determining the presence of a concealed mass of metal.<br>
The apparatus is variously connected. The cut shows a representative<br>
form; a and a' are two primary coils, each consisting of 100 meters (328<br>
feet) of No. 32 silk covered copper wire (0.009 inch diameter) wound on<br>
a boxwood spool ten inches in depth; b and b' are secondary coils. All<br>
coils are supposed to be alike. The primary coils are joined in series<br>
with a battery of three or four Daniell cells. A microphone m is<br>
included in the same circuit. The secondary coils are joined in series<br>
with a telephone and in opposition with each other. The clock is used to<br>
produce a sound affecting the microphone. If all is exactly balanced<br>
there will be no sound produced in the telephone. This balance is<br>
brought about by slightly varying the distance of one of the secondaries<br>
from the primary, until there is no sound in the telephone. If now a<br>
piece of metal is placed within either of the coils, it disturbs the<br>
balance and the telephone sounds.<br>
<br>
<br>
292&nbsp;&nbsp; STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.<br>
<br>
<br>
To measure the forces acting a sonometer or audiometer is used. This is<br>
shown in the upper part of the cut. Two fixed coils, c and e are mounted<br>
at the ends of a graduated bar. A movable coil d is connected in the<br>
telephone circuit; c and e by a switch can be connected with the battery<br>
and microphone circuit, leaving out the induction balance coils. The<br>
ends of the coils c and e, facing each other are of the same polarity.<br>
If these coils, c and e, were equal in all respects, no sound would be<br>
produced when d was midway between them. But they are so wound that the<br>
zero position for d is very near one of them, c.<br>
<br>
Assume that a balance has been obtained in the induction balance with<br>
the coil d at zero. No sound is heard whether the switch is moved to<br>
throw the current into one or the other circuit. A piece of metal placed<br>
in one of the balance coils will cause the production of a sound. The<br>
current is turned into the sonometer and d is moved until the same<br>
sound, as tested by rapid movements of the switch, is heard in both<br>
circuits. The displacement of d gives the value of the sound.<br>
<br>
A milligram of copper is enough to produce a loud sound. Two coins can<br>
be balanced against each other, and by rubbing one of them, or by<br>
breathing on one of them, the balance will be disturbed and a sound will<br>
be produced.<br>
<br>
Prof. Hughes has also dispensed with the audiometer. He has used a strip<br>
of zinc tapering from a width of 4 mm. (.16 inch) at one end to a sharp<br>
edge or point at the other. The piece to be tested being in place in one<br>
coil, the strip is moved across the face of the other until a balance is<br>
obtained.<br>
<br>
As possible uses the detection of counterfeit coins, the testing of<br>
metals for similarity of composition and the location of bullets in the<br>
body have been suggested. Care has to be taken that no masses of metal<br>
interfere. Thus in tests of the person of a wounded man, the presence of<br>
an iron truss, or of metallic bed springs may invalidate all<br>
conclusions.<br>
<br>
The same principle is carried out in an apparatus in which the parts are<br>
arranged like the members of a Wheatstone bridge. One pair of coils is<br>
used, which react on each other as primary and secondary coils. One of<br>
the coils is in series with a telephone in the member of the bridge<br>
corresponding to that containing the galvanometer of the Wheatstone<br>
bridge. The latter is more properly termed an induction bridge.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Hydro-electric Machine.</span><br>
An apparatus for generating high potential difference by the escape of<br>
steam through proper nozzles.<br>
<br>
It consists of a boiler mounted on four glass legs or otherwise<br>
insulated. An escape pipe terminates in a series of outlets so shaped as<br>
to impede the escape of the steam by forcing it out of the direct<br>
course. These jets are lined with hard wood. They are enclosed in or led<br>
through a box which is filled with cold water.<br>

<br>
This is to partly condense the steam so as to get it into the vesicular<br>
state, which is found essential to its action. Dry steam produces no<br>
excitation. If the boiler is fired and the steam is permitted to escape<br>
under the above conditions the vesicles presumably, or the "steam" is<br>
found to be electrified. A collecting comb held against the jet becomes<br>
charged and charges any connected surface.<br>
<br>
<br>
294&nbsp;&nbsp; STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.<br>
<br>
<br>
The boiler in the above case is negatively and the escaping "steam" is<br>
positively charged. By changing the material of the linings of the jets,<br>
or by adding turpentine the sign of the electricity is reversed. If the<br>
water contains acid or salts no electricity is produced. The regular<br>
hydro-electric machine is due to Sir William Armstrong.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Hydrogen.</span><br>
An element existing under all except the most extreme artificial<br>

substances. Atomic weight, 1; molecular weight, 2; equivalent, 1;<br>
valency, 1; specific gravity, .0691-.0695. (Dumas &amp; Boussingault.)<br>
<br>
It is a dielectric of about the same resistance as air. Its specific<br>
inductive capacity at atmospheric pressure is:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .9997 (Baltzman)&nbsp;&nbsp; .9998 (Ayrton)<br>
<br>
Electro-chemical equivalent, .0105 milligram.<br>
The above is usually taken as correct. Other values are as follows:<br>
.010521 (Kohllrausch)&nbsp;&nbsp; .010415 (Mascart)<br>

The electro-chemical equivalent of any element is obtained by<br>
multiplying its equivalent by the electro-chemical equivalent of<br>
hydrogen. The value .0105 has been used throughout this book.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Hygrometer.</span><br>
An instrument for determining the moisture in the air. One form consists<br>
of a pair of thermometers, one of which has its bulb wrapped in cloth<br>
which is kept moist during the observation. The evaporation is more or<br>
less rapid according to the dryness or moisture of the air, and as the<br>
temperature varies with this evaporation the relative readings of the<br>
two thermometers give the basis for calculating the hygrometric state of<br>
the air. Another form determines the temperature at which dew is<br>
deposited on a silver surface, whence the calculations are made.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Hysteresis, Magnetic.</span><br>
A phenomenon of magnetization of iron. It may be attributed to a sort of<br>
internal or molecular friction, causing energy to be absorbed when iron<br>
is magnetized. Whenever therefore the polarity or direction of<br>
magnetization of a mass of iron is rapidly changed a considerable<br>
expenditure of energy is required. It is attributed to the work done in<br>
bringing the molecules into the position of polarity.<br>
<br>
<br>
295&nbsp;&nbsp; STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.<br>
<br>
<br>
The electric energy lost by hysteresis may be reduced by vibrations or<br>
jarring imparted to the iron, thus virtually substituting mechanical for<br>
electrical work.<br>
<br>
On account of hysteresis the induced magnetization of a piece of iron or<br>
steel for fields of low intensity will depend on the manner in which the<br>
material has been already magnetized. Let the intensity of field<br>
increase, the magnetization increasing also; then lower the intensity;<br>
the substance tends to and does retain some of its magnetism. Then on<br>
again strengthening the field it will have something to build on, so<br>
that when it attains its former intensity the magnetization will exceed<br>
its former value. For a moderate value of intensity of field the<br>
magnetization can have many values within certain limits.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Ideoelectrics or Idioelectrics.</span><br>
Bodies which become electric by friction. This was the old definition,<br>

metals being thus electrified if held by insulating handles. The term is<br>

where the lines are tangential to the circle of the armature.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Idiostatic Method.</span><br>
A method of using the absolute or attracted disc electrometer. (See<br>
Electrometer, Absolute.) The suspended disc and guard ring are kept at<br>
the same potential, which is that of one of the points whose potential<br>
difference is to be determined; the lower fixed disc is connected to the<br>
other of the points whose potential difference is to be determined. Then<br>
we have the formula<br>
<br>
V = d * SquareRoot( 8 * PI * F ) / S<br>
<br>
in which d is the distance between the discs, V is the difference of<br>
potential of the two points, F the force of attraction between the discs<br>
in dynes, and S the area of the suspended disc. (See Heterostatic<br>
Method.)<br>

In arc lamps with fixed parallel carbons of the Jablochkoff type (see<br>
Candle, Jablochkoff) a strip of carbon connects the ends of the carbons<br>
in the unused candle. This is necessary to start the current. Such strip<br>
is called an igniter. It burns away in a very short time when an arc<br>
forms producing the light, and lasts, if all goes well, until the candle<br>
burns down to its end. Without the igniter the current would not start<br>
and no arc would form.<br>

by calculation in all directions from the source of light is called the<br>
spherical illuminating power, or if stated in candles is called the<br>
spherical candle power.<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Illumination, Unit of.</span><br>
An absolute standard of light received by a surface. Preece proposed as<br>
such the light received from a standard candle (see Candle, Standard) at<br>
a distance of 12.7 inches. The object of selecting this distance was to<br>
make it equal to the Carcel Standard (see Carcel), which is the light<br>
given by a Carcel lamp at a distance of one meter.<br>
<br>
From one-tenth to one-fiftieth this degree of illumination was found in<br>
gas-lighted streets by Preece, depending on the proximity of the gas<br>
lamps.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Inductance.</span><br>
The property of a circuit in virtue of which it exercises induction and<br>
develops lines of force. It is defined variously. As clear and<br>
satisfactory a definition as any is the following, due to Sumpner and<br>
Fleming: Inductance is the ratio between the total induction through a<br>
circuit to the current producing it. "Thus taking a simple helix of five<br>
turns carrying a current of two units, and assuming that 1,000 lines of<br>
force passed through the central turn, of which owing to leakage only<br>
900 thread the next adjacent on each side, and again only 800 through<br>
the end turns, there would be 800 + 900 + 1000 + 900 + 800, or 4,400<br>
linkages of lines with the wire, and this being with 2 units of current,<br>
there would be 2,200 linkages with unit current, and consequently the<br>
self-inductance of the helix would be 2,200 centimetres." (Kennelly.)<br>
Inductance, as regards its dimensions is usually reduced to a length,<br>

Henry; the secohm, or the quad or quadrant. The latter alludes to the<br>

[Transcriber's note: (L (di/dt) = V). A current changing at the rate of<br>
one ampere per second through a one henry inductance produces one volt.<br>
A sinusoidal current produces a voltage 90 degrees ahead of the current,<br>
a cosine (the derivative of sine is cosine). One volt across one henry<br>
causes the current to increase at one ampere per second.]<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Induction, Coefficient of Self.</span><br>
The coefficient of self-induction of a circuit is the quantity of<br>
induction passing through it per unit current in it. If a given circuit<br>
is carrying a varying current it is producing a varying quantity of<br>
magnetic induction through itself. The quantity of induction through the<br>
circuit due to its current is generally proportional to its current. The<br>
quantity for unit current is the coefficient of self-induction.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Induction, Cross.</span><br>
The induction of magnetic lines of force in a dynamo armature core by<br>
the current passing around such armature. These lines in a symmetrical<br>
two pole machine are at right angles to the lines of force which would<br>
normally extend across the space between the two magnet poles. The joint<br>
magnetizing effect of the field and of the cross induction produces a<br>
distorted field between the poles .<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Induction, Electro-magnetic.</span><br>
The inter-reaction of electromagnetic lines of force with the production<br>
of currents thereby.<br>
<br>
A current passing through a conductor establishes around it a field of<br>
force representing a series of circular lines of force concentric with<br>
the axis of the conductor and perpendicular thereto. These lines of<br>
force have attributed to them, as a representative of their polarity,<br>
direction. This is of course purely conventional. If one is supposed to<br>
be looking at the end of a section of conductor, assuming a current be<br>
passing through it towards the observer, the lines of force will have a<br>
direction opposite to the motion of the hands of a watch. The idea of<br>
direction may be referred to a magnet. In it the lines of force are<br>
assumed to go from the north pole through the air or other surrounding<br>
dielectric to the south pole.<br>
<br>
Two parallel wires having currents passing through them in the same<br>
direction will attract each other. This is because the oppositely<br>
directed segments of lines of force between the conductors destroy each<br>
other, and the resultant of the two circles is an approximation to an<br>
ellipse. As lines of force tend to be as short as possible the<br>
conductors tend to approach each other to make the ellipse become of as<br>
small area as possible, in other words to become a circle.<br>
<br>
If on the other hand the currents in the conductors are in opposite<br>
directions the segments of the lines of force between them will have<br>
similar directions, will, as it were, crowd the intervening ether and<br>
the wires will be repelled.<br>

By Amp&eacute;re's theory of magnetism, (see Magnetism, Amp&eacute;re's
Theory of,) a<br>
magnet is assumed to be encircled by currents moving in the direction<br>
opposite to that of the hands of a watch as the observer faces the north<br>
pole. A magnet near a wire tends to place the Amp&eacute;rian currents
parallel<br>
to the wire, and so that the portion of the Amp&eacute;rian currents
nearest<br>
thereto will correspond in direction with the current in the wire.<br>

<br>
Again if we think of a corkscrew, which as it is turned screws itself<br>
along with the current, the motion of the handle shows the direction of<br>
the lines of force and the direction in which the north pole of a needle<br>
is deflected. This much is perhaps more properly electro-dynamics, but<br>
is necessary as a basis for the expression of induction.<br>
<br>
If a current is varied in intensity in one conductor it will induce a<br>
temporary current in another conductor, part of which is parallel to the<br>
inducing current and which conductor is closed so as to form a circuit.<br>
If the inducing current is decreased the induced current in the near and<br>
parallel portion of the other circuit will be of identical direction; if<br>
increased the induced current will be of opposite direction.<br>
<br>
This is easiest figured by thinking of the lines of force surrounding<br>
the inducing conductor. If the current is decreased these can be<br>
imagined as receiving a twist or turn contrary to their normal<br>
direction, as thereby establishing a turn or twist in the ether<br>
surrounding the other wire corresponding in direction with the direction<br>
of the original lines of force, or what is the same thing, opposite in<br>
direction to the original twist. But we may assume that the<br>
establishment of such a disturbance causes a current, which must be<br>
governed in direction with the requirements of the new lines of force.<br>
<br>
The same reasoning applies to the opposite case.<br>
<br>
<br>
301&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.<br>
<br>
<br>
The general statement of a variable current acting on a neighboring<br>
circuit also applies to the approach or recession of an unvarying<br>
current, and to the cutting of lines of force by a conductor at right<br>
angles thereto. For it is evident that the case of a varying current is<br>
the case of a varying number of lines of force cutting or being cut by<br>
the neighboring conductor. As lines of force always imply a current,<br>
they always imply a direction of such current. The cutting of any lines<br>
of force by a closed conductor always implies a change of position with<br>
reference to all portions of such conductor and to the current and<br>
consequently an induced current or currents in one or the other<br>
direction in the moving conductor.<br>
<br>
As the inducing of a current represents energy abstracted from that of<br>
the inducing circuit, the direction of the induced current is determined<br>
by (Lenz's Law) the rule that the new current will increase already<br>
existing resistances or develop new ones to the disturbance of the<br>
inducing field.<br>
<br>
In saying that a conductor cutting lines of force at right angles to<br>
itself has a current induced in it, it must be understood that if not at<br>
right angles the right angle component of the direction of the wire acts<br>
in generating the current. The case resolves itself into the number of<br>
lines of force cut at any angle by the moving wire.<br>
<br>
The lines of force may be produced by a magnet, permanent or electro.<br>
This introduces no new element. The magnet may be referred, as regards<br>
direction of its lines of force, to its encircling currents, actual or<br>
Amp&eacute;rian, and the application of the laws just cited will cover
all<br>
cases.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Induction, Coefficient of Mutual.</span><br>
The coefficient of mutual induction of two circuits is the quantity of<br>
magnetic induction passing through either of them per unit current in<br>
the other. (Emtage.) It is also defined as the work which must be done<br>
on either circuit, against the action of unit current in each, to take<br>
it away from its given position to an infinite distance from the other;<br>
and also as the work which would be done by either circuit on the other<br>
in consequence of unit current in each, as the other moves from an<br>
infinite distance to its given position with respect to the other<br>
conductor. It depends on the form, size, and relative position of the<br>
two circuits; and on the magnetic susceptibilities of neighboring<br>
substances.<br>
<br>
The ether surrounding two circuits of intensity i' and i" must possess<br>
energy, expressible (Maxwell) as 1/2 L i2 + M i i + 1/2 N i12. It can be<br>
shown that M i i1 in any given position of the two circuits is<br>
numerically equal (1) to the mutual potential energy of the two circuits<br>
(2) to the number of lines of induction, which being due to A, pass from<br>
A through B, or equally being due to B, pass from B through A, and M is<br>
styled the coefficient of mutual induction. (Daniell.)<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Induction, Electrostatic.</span><br>
An electrostatic charge has always an opposite and bound charge. This<br>
may be so distributed as not to be distinguishable, in which case the<br>
charge is termed, incorrectly but conventionally, a free charge. But<br>
when a charge is produced an opposite and equal one always is formed,<br>
which is the bound charge. The region between the two charges and<br>
permeated by their lines of force, often curving out so as to embrace a<br>
volume of cross-sectional area larger than the mean facing area of the<br>
excited surfaces, is an electrostatic field of force. The establishing<br>
of an electrostatic field, and the production of a bound charge are<br>
electrostatic induction.<br>
<br>
An insulated conductor brought into such a field suffers a<br>
redistribution of its electricity, or undergoes electrostatic induction.<br>
The parts nearest respectively, the two loci of the original and the<br>
bound charges, are excited oppositely to such charges. The conductor<br>
presents two new bound charges, one referred to the original charge, the<br>
other to the first bound charge.<br>

In an iron or steel ship the induction exercised upon the compass needle<br>
by the horizontal members of the structure, such as deck-beams, when<br>
they are polarized by the earth's magnetic induction. This induction<br>
disappears four times in swinging a ship through a circle; deviation due<br>
to it is termed quadrantal deviation. (See Deviation, Quadrantal.)<br>

<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Induction, Magnetic.</span><br>
The magnetization of iron or other paramagnetic substance by a magnetic<br>
field.<br>
<br>
On account of its permeability or multiplying power for lines of force,<br>
a paramagnetic body always concentrates lines of force in itself if<br>
placed in a magnetic field, and hence becomes for the time being a<br>
magnet, or is said to be polarized.<br>
<br>
As the tendency of lines of force is to follow the most permeable path,<br>
a paramagnetic bar places itself lengthwise or parallel with the<br>
prevailing direction of the lines of force so as to carry them as far on<br>
their way as possible. Every other position of the bar is one of<br>
unstable equilibrium or of no equilibrium. The end of the bar where the<br>
lines of force enter (see Lines of Force) is a south pole and is<br>
attracted towards the north pole of the magnet.<br>
<br>
The production of magnetic poles under these conditions in the bar is<br>
shown by throwing iron filings upon it. They adhere to both ends but not<br>
to the middle.<br>

A charged body always induces a charge upon any other body near it; and<br>
the same charge in the second body will induce the other charge in the<br>
first body if the latter is unexcited. In other words the second body's<br>
induction from the first is the measure of the charge the second would<br>
require to induce in the first its own (the second's) induced charge.<br>
This is the law of mutual electrostatic induction.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Induction, Open Circuit.</span><br>
Inductive effects produced in open circuits. By oscillatory discharges a<br>
discharge can be produced across a break in a circuit otherwise<br>
complete. The requirements for its production involve a correspondence<br>
or relation of its dimensions to the inducing discharge. The whole is<br>
analogous to the phenomena of sound resonators and sympathetic<br>
vibrations. Synonym--Oscillatory induction.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Induction, Self-.</span><br>
(a) A phenomenon of electric currents analogous to the inertia of<br>
matter. Just as water which fills a pipe would resist a sudden change in<br>
its rate of motion, whether to start from rest, to cease or decrease its<br>
motion, so an electric current requires an appreciable time to start and<br>
stop. It is produced most strongly in a coiled conductor, especially if<br>
a core of iron is contained within it.<br>
<br>
As in the case of two parallel wires, one bearing currents which vary,<br>
momentary currents are induced in the other wire, so in a single<br>
conductor a species of inertia is found which retards and prolongs the<br>
current. If a single conductor is twisted into a helix or corresponding<br>
shape, its separate turns react one on the other in accordance with the<br>
general principles of electromagnetic induction. (See Induction,<br>
Electro-magnetic.) Thus when a current is suddenly formed the coils<br>
acting upon each other retard for an instant its passage, producing the<br>
effect of a reverse induced current or extra current opposing the<br>
principal current. Of course no extra current is perceptible, but only<br>
the diminution. When the current is passing regularly and the current is<br>
broken, the corresponding action prolongs the current or rather<br>
intensifies it for an instant, producing the true extra current. This is<br>
current self-induction.<br>

In the brush dynamo a thin sheet of copper surrounding the magnet cores<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Induction, Unipolar.</span><br>
Induction produced in a conductor which continuously cuts the lines of<br>

is produced.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Induction, Vertical.</span><br>
In an iron or steel ship the induction or attraction exercised in the<br>
compass by vertical elements of the structure. Such vertical masses of<br>
iron in the northern hemisphere would have their upper ends polarized as<br>
south poles, and would affect the magnet as soon as the vessel swung out<br>
of the magnetic meridian. Thus this induction disappears twice in<br>
swinging a ship through a complete circle; deviation due to it is termed<br>
semi-circular deviation. (See Deviation, Semi-circular.)<br>

The products of decomposition produced in any given electrolysis are<br>

the anion. The electrode connected to the carbon or copper plate of a<br>
wet battery is an anode. Thus in the electrolysis of water oxygen is the<br>
anion and hydrogen is termed the kation. In this case both anion and<br>
kation are elements. In the decomposition of copper sulphate the anion<br>
is properly speaking sulphion (S O4), a radical, and the kation is<br>
copper, an element. Electro-negative elements or radicals are anions,<br>
such as oxygen, sulphion, etc., while electro-positive ones are kations,<br>
such as potassium. Again one substance may be an anion referred to one<br>
below it and a kation referred to one above it, in the electro-chemical<br>

A joint for uniting the ends of telegraph and electric wires. The ends<br>
of the wires are scraped clean and laid alongside each other for two<br>
inches, the extreme ends being bent up at about right angles to the<br>
wire. A thin wire is wound four or five times around one of the wires,<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Joint, Butt.</span><br>
A joint in belting or in wire in which the ends to be joined are cut off<br>
square across, placed in contact and secured. It ensures even running<br>
when used in belting. Any irregularity in thickness of a belt affects<br>
the speed of the driven pulley. As dynamos are generally driven by<br>
belts, and it is important to drive them at an even speed to prevent<br>
variations in the electro-motive force, butt joints should be used on<br>
belting for them, unless a very perfect lap joint is made, which does<br>
not affect either the thickness or the stiffness of the belt.<br>
<br>
When a butt joint is used in wire a sleeve may be used to receive the<br>
abutting ends, which may be secured therein by soldering. This species<br>
of joint has been used on lightning rods and may more properly be termed<br>
a sleeve joint.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Joint, Lap.</span><br>
(a) In belting a joint in which the ends are overlapped, and riveted or<br>
otherwise secured in place. If made without reducing the thickness of<br>
the ends it is a bad joint for electrical work, as it prevents even<br>
running of machinery to which it is applied. Hence dynamo belts should<br>
be joined by butt joints, or if by lap joints the ends should be shaved<br>
off so that when joined and riveted, there will be no variation in the<br>
thickness of the belt.<br>
<br>
(b) In wire lap joints are made by overlapping the ends of the wire and<br>
soldering or otherwise securing. The Britannia joint (see Joint,<br>
Britannia,) may be considered a lap-joint.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Joint, Marriage.</span><br>
A joint for stranded conductors used for Galende's cables. It is made<br>
somewhat like a sailor's long splice. Each one of the strands is wound<br>

ends are cut off so as to abutt. In this way all are smoothly laid in<br>
place and soldering is next applied.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Joint, Splayed.</span><br>
The method of joining the ends of stranded conductors. The insulating<br>
covering is removed, the wires are opened out, and the center wire,<br>
heart or core of the cable is cut off short. The two ends are brought<br>
together, the opened out wires are interlaced or crotched like the<br>
fingers of the two hands, and the ends are wound around the body of the<br>
cable in opposite directions. The joint is trimmed and well soldered.<br>
Tinned wire with rosin flux for the soldering is to be recommended.<br>
Insulating material is finally applied by hand, with heat if necessary.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Joints in Belts.</span><br>
Belt-joints for electric plants where the belts drive dynamos should be<br>
made with special care. The least inequality affects the electro-motive<br>
force. Butt joints are, generally speaking, the best, where the ends of<br>
the belt are placed in contact and laced. Lap-joints are made by<br>
overlapping the belt, and unless the belt is carefully tapered so as to<br>
preserve uniform strength, the speed of the dynamo will vary and also<br>
the electromotive force.<br>

A key for use with a Wheatstone Bridge, q.v. It is desirable to first<br>
send a current through the four arms of the bridge in using it for<br>
testing resistances and then through the galvanometer, because it takes<br>
a definite time for the current to reach its full strength. This is<br>
especially the case if the element being measured has high static<br>
capacity, as a long ocean cable. If the galvanometer connections were<br>
completed simultaneously with the bridge connections a momentary swing<br>
would be produced even if the arms bore the proper relation to each<br>
other. This would cause delay in the testing. A bridge key avoids this<br>
by first connecting the battery circuit through the arms of the bridge,<br>
and then as it is still further depressed the galvanometer circuit is<br>
completed.<br>

<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Key, Charge and Discharge.</span><br>
A key for use in observing the discharge of a condenser immediately<br>
after removing the battery. In one typical form it has two contacts, one<br>
below and one above, and being a spring in itself is pressed up against<br>
the upper one. Connections are so made that when in its upper position<br>
it brings the two coatings of the condenser in circuit with the<br>
galvanometer. When depressed it does the same for a battery. In use it<br>
is depressed and suddenly released when the galvanometer receives the<br>
full charge, before there has been time for leakage. This is one method<br>
of connection illustrating its principle.<br>
<br>
In the cut L is the spring-key proper. S2, is the upper contact screw<br>
against which the spring normally presses. In this position the<br>
galvanometer G is in circuit with the opposite coatings of the condenser<br>
C. On depressing the contact S2, is broken and S1, is made. This brings<br>
the battery B in circuit with the condenser coatings. On releasing the<br>
key it springs up and the galvanometer receives the effect of the charge<br>
of the condenser as derived from the battery.<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Key, Kempe's Discharge.</span><br>
A key giving a charging, discharging and insulating connection, for<br>
static condenser work. Referring to the cut l is a lever or spring with<br>
upper discharging contact s, and lower charging contact s'. In use it is<br>
pressed down by the insulating handle or finger piece C, until caught by<br>
the hook attached to the key I. This hook is lower down than that on the<br>
key D, and holds it in contact with the charging contact piece S'. On<br>
pressing the key I, marked or designated "Insulate," it springs up,<br>
breaks contact at S', and catching against the hook on D, which key is<br>
designated "Discharge," remains insulated from both contacts; next on<br>
pressing D it is released and springs up and closes the discharge<br>
contact S. It is a form of charge and discharge key. (See Key, Charge<br>
and Discharge.)<br>
<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Key, Magneto-electric.</span><br>
A telegraph key whose movements operate what is virtually a small<br>
magneto-generator, so as to produce currents of alternating direction,<br>
one impulse for each motion of the key. It is employed for telegraphing<br>
without a line battery, a polarized relay being used. In one very simple<br>
form a key is mounted on a base with a permanent magnet and connected to<br>
the armature, so that when the key is pressed downwards it draws the<br>
armature away from the poles of the magnet. If the magnet or its<br>
armature is wound with insulated wire this action of the key will cause<br>
instantaneous currents to go through a circuit connected to the magnet<br>
or armature coils.<br>

<br>
In Siemens &amp; Halske's key an H armature E is pivoted between the
poles N<br>
S, of a powerful compound horseshoe magnet, G G. It is wound with fine<br>
wire and a key handle H is provided for working it. In its normal<br>
position the handle is drawn upward, and the end S S of the armature<br>
core is in contact with the south pole S of the permanent magnet, and<br>
the end D D with the north pole. This establishes the polarity of the<br>
armature. On depressing the key the contacts are broken and in their<br>
place the end D D comes in contact with the south pole and the end S S<br>
with the north pole. This suddenly reverses the polarity of the armature<br>
and sends a momentary current through the armature coil which is in<br>
circuit with the line. The cut only shows the principle of the key,<br>
whose construction is quite complicated.<br>

slightly coned or with its end split so as to give it spring action is<br>
thrust between the blocks to complete the circuit. It is used in<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Key, Reversing.</span><br>
(a) A double key, arranged so that by depressing one key a current flows<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Key, Sliding-Contact.</span><br>
A name given to the key used for making instantaneous contacts with the<br>
metre wire of a metre bridge, q. v. The name is not strictly correct,<br>
because it is important that there should be no sliding contact made, as<br>
it would wear out the wire and make it of uneven resistance.<br>
<br>
It is a key which slides along over the wire and which, when depressed,<br>
presses a platinum tipped knife edge upon the wire. On being released<br>
from pressure the key handle springs up and takes the knife edge off the<br>
wire. This removal is essential to avoid wearing the wire, whose<br>
resistance per unit of length must be absolutely uniform.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Key, Telegraph.</span><br>
The key used in telegraphy for sending currents as desired over the<br>

stationary contact point on the base. This closes the circuit through<br>
the line. When released it springs up and opens the line circuit.<br>

These relate to divided circuits.<br>
<br>
I. When a steady current branches, the quantity of electricity arriving<br>
by the single wire is equal to the quantity leaving the junction by the<br>
branches. The algebraical sum of the intensities of the currents passing<br>
towards (or passing from) the junction is equal to zero; Summation(C) =<br>
0 (Daniell.) In the last sentence currents flowing towards the point are<br>
considered of one sign and those flowing away from it of the other.<br>
<br>
II. In a metallic circuit comprising within it a source of permanent<br>
difference of potential, E, the products of the intensity of the current<br>
within each part of the circuit into the corresponding resistance are,<br>
if the elements of current be all taken in cyclical order together,<br>
equal to E; Summation(C * r) =E. In a metallic circuit in which there is<br>
no source of permanent difference of potential E = 0, and Summation(C *<br>
r)&nbsp; = 0.<br>
<br>
This law applies to each several mesh of a wire network as well as to a<br>
single metallic loop, and it holds good even when an extraneous current<br>
is passed through the loop. (Daniell.)<br>
<br>
In this statement of the two laws E stands for electro-motive force, C<br>
for current intensity; and r for resistance of a single member of the<br>
circuit.<br>
<br>
[Transcriber's note: These laws may be restated as: At any point in an<br>
steady-state electrical circuit, the directed sum of currents flowing<br>
towards that point is zero. The directed sum of the electrical potential<br>
differences around any closed circuit is zero.]<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Knife-edge Suspension.</span><br>
The suspension of an object on a sharp edge of steel or agate. The knife<br>
edge should abut against a plane. The knife edge is generally carried by<br>
the poised object. Its edge then faces downward and on the support one<br>
or more plane or approximately plane surfaces are provided on which it<br>
rests. In the ordinary balance this suspension can be seen. It is<br>
sometimes used in the dipping needle.<br>

laminated. Thus a drum armature core may consist of a quantity of thin<br>
iron discs, strung upon a rod and rigidly secured, either with or<br>
without paper insulation between the discs. If no paper is used the film<br>
of oxide on the iron is relied on for insulation. The object of<br>
lamination is to break up the electrical continuity of the core, so as<br>
to avoid Foucault currents. (See Currents, Foucault.) The laminations<br>
should be at right angles to the direction of the Foucault currents<br>
which would be produced, or in most cases should be at right angles to<br>
the active parts of the wire windings.<br>

Fig. 210. PILSEN ARC LAMP.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Lamp, Arc.</span><br>
A lamp in which the light is produced by a voltaic arc. Carbon<br>
electrodes are almost universally employed. Special mechanism, operating<br>
partly by spring or gravity and partly by electricity, is employed to<br>
regulate the distance apart of the carbons, to let them touch when no<br>
current passes, and to separate them when current is first turned on.<br>
<br>
The most varied constructions have been employed, examples of which will<br>
be found in their places. Lamps may in general be divided into classes<br>
as follows, according to their regulating mechanism and other features:<br>
<br>
(a) Single light regulators or monophotes. Lamps through whose<br>
regulating mechanism the whole current passes. These are only adapted to<br>
work singly; if several are placed in series on the same circuit, the<br>
action of one regulator interferes with that of the next one.<br>
<br>
(b) Multiple light regulators or polyphotes. In these the regulating<br>
mechanism and the carbons with their arc are in parallel; the regulating<br>
device may be a single magnet or solenoid constituting a derived or<br>
shunt-circuit lamp, or it may include two magnets working differentially<br>
against or in opposition to each other constituting a differential lamp.<br>
<br>
<br>
320&nbsp;&nbsp; STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.<br>
<br>
<br>
(c) Lamps with fixed parallel carbons termed candles (q. v., of various<br>
types).<br>
<br>
(d) Lamps without regulating mechanism. These include lamps with<br>
converging carbons, whose object was to dispense with the regulating<br>
mechanism, but which in some cases have about as much regulating<br>
mechanism as any of the ordinary arc lamps.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Lamp, Contact.</span><br>
A lamp depending for its action on loose contact between two carbon<br>
electrodes. At the contact a species of incandescence with incipient<br>
arcs is produced. One of the electrodes is usually flat or nearly so,<br>
and the other one of pencil shape rests upon it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Lamp, Differential Arc.</span><br>
An arc lamp, the regulation of the distance between whose carbons<br>
depends on the differential action of two separate electrical coils. The<br>
diagram illustrates the principle. The two carbons are seen in black;<br>
the upper one is movable, The current arrives at A. It divides, and the<br>
greater part goes through the low resistance coil M to a contact roller<br>
r, and thence by the frame to the upper carbon, and through the arc and<br>
lower carbon to B, where it leaves the lamp. A smaller portion of the<br>
current goes through the coil M1 of higher resistance and leaves the<br>
lamp also at B. A double conical iron core is seen, to which the upper<br>
carbon holder is attached. This is attracted in opposite directions by<br>
the two coils. If the arc grows too long its resistance increases and<br>
the coil M1 receiving more current draws it down and thus shortens the<br>
arc. If the arc grows too short, its resistance falls, and the coil M<br>
receives more current and draws the core upwards, thus lengthening the<br>
arc. This differential action of the two cores gives the lamp its name.<br>
R is a pulley over which a cord passes, one end attached to the core and<br>
the other to a counterpoise weight, W.<br>

A lamp designed for use alone upon its own circuit. These have the<br>

whole current goes through both. (See Lamp, Arc.)<br>
<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Lamp-hour.</span><br>
A unit of commercial supply of electric energy; the volt-coulombs<br>
required to maintain an electric lamp for one hour. A sixteen-candle<br>
power incandescent lamp is practically the lamp alluded to, and requires<br>
about half an ampere current at 110 volts, making a lamp-hour equal to<br>
about 198,000 volt-coulombs.<br>
<br>
[Transcriber's note: 0.55 KW hours.]<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Lamp, Incandescent.</span><br>
An electric lamp in which the light is produced by heating to whiteness<br>
a refractory conductor by the passage of a current of electricity. It is<br>
distinguished from an arc lamp (which etymologically is also an<br>
incandescent lamp) by the absence of any break in the continuity of its<br>
refractory conductor. Many different forms and methods of construction<br>
have been tried, but now all have settled into approximately the same<br>
type.<br>
<br>
The incandescent lamp consists of a small glass bulb, called the<br>
lamp-chamber, which is exhausted of air and hermetically sealed. It<br>
contains a filament of carbon, bent into a loop of more or less simple<br>
shape. This shape prevents any tensile strain upon the loop and also<br>
approximates to the outline of a regular flame.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
322&nbsp;&nbsp; STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.<br>
<br>
<br>
The loop is attached at its ends to two short pieces of platinum wire,<br>
which pass through the glass of the bulb and around which the glass is<br>
fused. As platinum has almost exactly the same coefficient of<br>
heat-expansion as glass, the wires do not cause the glass to crack.<br>
<br>
The process of manufacture includes the preparation of the filament.<br>
This is made from paper, silk, bamboo fibre, tamidine, q. v., or other<br>
material. After shaping into the form of the filament the material is<br>
carbonized at a high heat, while embedded in charcoal, or otherwise<br>
protected from the air. The flashing process (see Flashing of<br>
incandescent Lamp Carbons) may also be applied. The attachment to the<br>
platinum wires is effected by a minute clamp or by electric soldering.<br>
The loop is inserted and secured within the open globe, which the glass<br>
blower nearly closes, leaving one opening for exhaustion.<br>
<br>
The air is pumped out, perhaps first by a piston pump, but always at the<br>
end by a mercurial air pump. (See Pump, Geissler--and others.) As the<br>
exhaustion becomes high a current is passed through the carbons heating<br>
them eventually to white heat so as to expel occluded gas. The occluded<br>
gases are exhausted by the pump and the lamp is sealed by melting the<br>
glass with a blowpipe or blast-lamp flame. For the exhaustion several<br>
lamps are usually fastened together by branching glass tubes, and are<br>
sealed off one by one.<br>
<br>
The incandescent lamps require about 3.5 watts to the candle power, or<br>
give about 12 sixteen-candle lamps to the horse power expended on them.<br>
<br>
Generally incandescent lamps are run in parallel or on multiple arc<br>
circuits. All that is necessary in such distribution systems is to<br>
maintain a proper potential difference between the two leads across<br>
which the lamps are connected. In the manufacture of lamps they are<br>
brought to an even resistance and the proper voltage at which they<br>
should be run is often marked upon them. This may be fifty volts and<br>
upward. One hundred and ten volts is a very usual figure. As current one<br>
ampere for a fifty-volt, or about one-half an ampere for a one hundred<br>
and ten volt lamp is employed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Lamp, Incandescent, Three Filament.</span><br>
A three filament lamp is used for three phase currents. It has three<br>
filaments whose inner ends are connected, and each of which has one<br>
leading-in wire. The three wires are connected to the three wires of the<br>
circuit. Each filament receives a current varying in intensity, so that<br>
there is always one filament passing a current equal to the sum of the<br>
currents in the other two filaments.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Lamp, Lighthouse.</span><br>
A special type of arc light. It is adapted for use in a lighthouse<br>
dioptric lantern, and hence its arc has to be maintained in the same<br>
position, in the focus of the lenses. The lamps are so constructed as to<br>
feed both carbons instead of only one, thereby securing the above<br>
object.<br>

<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Lamp, Polyphote.</span><br>
An arc lamp adapted to be used, a number in series, upon the same<br>
circuit. The electric regulating mechanism is placed in shunt or in<br>
parallel with the carbons and arc. (See Lamp, Arc.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Lamps, Bank of.</span><br>
A number of lamps mounted on a board or other base, and connected to<br>
serve as voltage indicator or to show the existence of grounds, or for<br>
other purposes.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Lamp, Semi-incandescent.</span><br>
A lamp partaking of the characteristics of both arc and incandescence; a<br>
lamp in which the imperfect contact of two carbon electrodes produces a<br>
part of or all of the resistance to the current which causes<br>
incandescence.<br>
<br>
The usual type of these lamps includes a thin carbon rod which rests<br>
against a block of carbon. The species of arc formed at the junction of<br>
the two heats the carbons. Sometimes the upper carbon or at least its<br>
end is heated also by true incandescence, the current being conveyed<br>
near to its end before entering it.<br>
<br>
Semi-incandescent lamps are not used to any extent now.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Lamp Socket.</span><br>
A receptacle for an incandescent lamp; the lamp being inserted the<br>
necessary connections with the two leads are automatically made in most<br>
sockets. The lamps may be screwed or simply thrust into the socket and<br>
different ones are constructed for different types of lamps. A key for<br>
turning the current on and off is often a part of the socket.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Law of Intermediate Metals.</span><br>
A law of thermo-electricity. The electro-motive force between any two<br>
metals is equal to the sum of electro-motive forces between each of the<br>
two metals and any intermediate metal in the thermo-electric series, or<br>
the electro-motive force between any two metals is equal to the sum of<br>
the electromotive forces between all the intermediate ones and the<br>
original two metals; it is the analogue of Volta's Law, q. v.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Law of Inverse Squares.</span><br>
When force is exercised through space from a point, its intensity varies<br>
inversely with the square of the distance. Thus the intensity of light<br>
radiated by a luminous point at twice a given distance therefrom is of<br>
one-fourth the intensity it had at the distance in question.<br>
Gravitation, electric and magnetic attraction and repulsion and other<br>
radiant forces are subject to the same law.<br>

A law of thermo-electricity. The electro-motive force due to a given<br>
difference of temperature between the opposite junctions of the metals<br>
is equal to the sum of the electro-motive forces produced by fractional<br>
differences of temperature, whose sum is equal to the given difference<br>
and whose sum exactly fills the given range of temperature.<br>

A law expressing the relations of direction of an inducing current or<br>
field of force to the current induced by any disturbance in the<br>
relations between such field and any closed conductor within its<br>
influence. It may be variously expressed.<br>
<br>
(a) If the relative position of two conductors, A and B, be changed, of<br>
which A is traversed by a current, a current is induced in B in such a<br>
direction that, by its electro-dynamic action on the current in A, it<br>
would have imparted to the conductors a motion of the contrary kind to<br>
that by which the inducing action was produced. (Ganot.)<br>
<br>
(b) The new (induced) current will increase the already existing<br>
resistances, or develop new resistance to that disturbance of the field<br>
which is the cause of induction. (Daniell.)<br>
<br>
(c) When a conductor is moving in a magnetic field a current is induced<br>
in the conductor in such a direction as by its mechanical action to<br>
oppose the motion. (Emtage.)<br>

<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Leyden Jar.</span><br>
A form of static condenser.<br>
<br>
In its usual form it consists of a glass jar. Tinfoil is pasted around<br>
the lower portions of its exterior and interior surfaces, covering from<br>
one-quarter to three-quarters of the walls in ordinary examples. The<br>
rest of the glass is preferably shellacked or painted over with<br>
insulating varnish, q. v. The mouth is closed with a wooden or cork<br>
stopper and through its centre a brass rod passes which by a short chain<br>
or wire is in connection with the interior coating of the jar. The top<br>
of the rod carries a brass knob or ball.<br>
<br>
If such a jar is held by the tinfoil-covered surface in one hand and its<br>
knob is held against the excited prime conductor of a static machine its<br>
interior becomes charged; an equivalent quantity of the same electricity<br>
is repelled through the person of the experimenter to the earth and when<br>
removed from the conductor it will be found to hold a bound charge. If<br>
the outer coating and knob are both touched or nearly touched by a<br>
conductor a disruptive discharge through it takes place.<br>

shock. This is done by their joining hands, a person at one end touching<br>
the outer coating and another person at the other end touching the knob.<br>

From an influence machine a charge can be taken by connecting the<br>
coating to one electrode and the knob to the other.<br>

Fig. 214. SULPHURIC ACID LEYDEN JAR.<br>
<br>
<br>
327&nbsp;&nbsp; STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Leyden Jar, Sir William Thomson's.</span><br>
An especially efficient form of Leyden jar. It consists of a jar with<br>
outer tinfoil coating only. For the interior coating is substituted a<br>
quantity of concentrated sulphuric acid. The central rod is of lead with<br>
a foot, which is immersed in the acid and from which the rod rises. A<br>
wooden cover partly closes the jar, as the central tube through which<br>
the rod passes is so large as not to allow the wood to touch it. Thus<br>
any leakage from inner to outer coating has to pass over the inside and<br>
outside glass surfaces. In the common form of jar the wooden cover may<br>
short circuit the uncoated portion of the inner glass surface. In the<br>
cut a simplified form of Thomson's Leyden jar is shown, adapted for<br>
scientific work.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Lichtenberg's Figures.</span><br>
If the knob of a Leyden jar or other exited electrode is rubbed over the<br>
surface of ebonite, shellac, resin or other non-conducting surface it<br>
leaves it electrified in the path of the knob. If fine powder such as<br>
flowers of sulphur or lycopodium is dusted over the surface and the<br>
excess is blown away, the powder will adhere where the surface was<br>
electrified, forming what are called Lichtenberg's Figures, Lycopodium<br>
and sulphur show both positive and negative figures, that is to say,<br>
figures produced by a positively or negatively charged conductor. Red<br>
lead adheres only to negative figures. If both positive and negative<br>
figures are made and the surface is sprinkled with both red lead and<br>
flowers of sulphur each picks out its own figure, the sulphur going<br>
principally to the positive one.<br>
<br>
The red lead takes the form of small circular heaps, the sulphur<br>
arranges itself in tufts with numerous diverging branches. This<br>
indicates the difference in the two electricities. The figures have been<br>
described as "a very sensitive electrosope for investigating the<br>
distribution of electricity on an insulating surface." (Ganot.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Life of Incandescent Lamps.</span><br>
The period of time a lamp remains in action before the carbon filament<br>
is destroyed. The cause of a lamp failing may be the volatilization of<br>
the carbon of the filament, causing it to become thin and to break; or<br>
the chamber may leak. The life of the lamp varies; 600 hours is a fair<br>
estimate. Sometimes they last several times this period.<br>
<br>
The higher the intensity at which they are used the shorter is their<br>
life. From their prime cost and the cost of current the most economical<br>
way to run them can be approximately calculated.<br>
<br>
[Transcriber's note: Contemporary incandecent buls are rated for 1000<br>
hours; flourescent bulbs up to 24000 hours; LED lamps up to 100000
hours.]<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Lightning.</span><br>
The electrostatic discharge to the earth or among themselves of clouds<br>
floating in the atmosphere. The discharge is accompanied by a spark or<br>
other luminous effect, which may be very bright and the effects, thermal<br>
and mechanical, are often of enormous intensity.<br>
<br>
The lightning flash is white near the earth, but in the upper regions<br>
where the air is rarefied it is of a blue tint, like the spark of the<br>
electric machine. The flashes are often over a mile in length, and<br>
sometimes are four or five miles long. They have sometimes a curious<br>
sinuous and often a branching shape, which has been determined by<br>
photography only recently. To the eye the shape seems zigzag.<br>
<br>
<br>
328&nbsp;&nbsp; STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.<br>
<br>
<br>
In the case of a mile-long flash it has been estimated that 3,516,480 De<br>
la Rue cells, q. v., would be required for the development of the<br>
potential, giving the flash over three and one-half millions of volts.<br>
But as it is uncertain how far the discharge is helped on its course by<br>
the rain drops this estimate may be too high.<br>
<br>
There are two general types of flash. The so-called zigzag flash<br>
resembles the spark of an electric machine, and is undoubtedly due to<br>
the disruptive discharge from cloud to earth. Sheet lightning has no<br>
shape, simply is a sudden glow, and from examination of the spectrum<br>
appears to be brush discharges (see Discharge, Brush) between clouds.<br>
Heat lightning is attributed to flashes below the horizon whose light<br>
only is seen by us. Globe or ball lightning takes the form of globes of<br>
fire, sometimes visible for ten seconds, descending from the clouds. On<br>
reaching the earth they sometimes rebound, and sometimes explode with a<br>
loud detonation. No adequate explanation has been found for them.<br>
<br>
The flash does not exceed one-millionth of a second in duration; its<br>
absolute light is believed to be comparable to that of the sun, but its<br>
brief duration makes its total light far less than that of the sun for<br>
any period of time.<br>
<br>
If the disruptive discharge passes through a living animal it is often<br>
fatal. As it reaches the earth it often has power enough to fuse sand,<br>
producing fulgurites, q. v. (See also Back Shock or Stroke of<br>
Lightning.)<br>
<br>
Volcanic lightning, which accompanies the eruptions of volcanoes, is<br>
attributed to friction of the volcanic dust and to vapor condensation.<br>
<br>
[Transcriber's note: The origin of lightning is still (2008) not fully<br>
understood, but is thought to relate to charge separation in the<br>
vertical motion of water droplets and ice crystals in cloud updrafts. A<br>
lightning bolt carries a current of 40,000 to 120,000 amperes, and<br>
transfers a charge of about five coulombs. Nearby air is heated to about<br>
10,000 &deg;C (18,000 &deg;F), almost twice the temperature of the Sun&#8217;s<br>
surface.]<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Lightning Arrester.</span><br>
An apparatus for use with electric lines to carry off to earth any<br>
lightning discharge such lines may pick up. Such discharge would imperil<br>
life as well as property in telegraph offices and the like.<br>
<br>
Arresters are generally constructed on the following lines. The line<br>
wires have connected to them a plate with teeth; a second similar plate<br>
is placed near this with its teeth opposite to those of the first plate<br>
and nearly touching it. The second plate is connected by a low<br>
resistance conductor to ground. Any lightning discharge is apt to jump<br>
across the interval, of a small fraction of an inch, between the<br>
oppositely placed points and go to earth.<br>
<br>
Another type consists of two plates, placed face to face, and pressing<br>
between them a piece of paper or mica. The lightning is supposed to<br>
perforate this and go to earth. One plate is connected to the line, the<br>
other one is grounded.<br>
<br>
The lightning arrester is placed near the end of the line before it<br>
reaches any instrument. (See Alternative Paths.)<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Lightning Arrester,
Counter-electro-motive Force.</span><br>
An invention of Prof. Elihu Thompson. A lightning arrester in which the<br>
lightning discharge sets up a counter-electro-motive force opposed to<br>
its own. This it does by an induction coil. If a discharge to earth<br>
takes place it selects the primary of the coil as it has low<br>
self-induction. In its discharge it induces in the secondary a reverse<br>
electro-motive force which protects the line.<br>

also.<br>
<br>
A high tension discharge, such as that of lightning, goes to earth<br>
across the partial vacuum in preference to going through the line, which<br>
by its capacity and self-induction opposes the passage through it of a<br>
lightning discharge.<br>
<br>
It is especially adapted for underground and submarine lines.<br>

Lightning is sometimes observed which seems to ascend. It is thought<br>
that this may be due to positive electrification of the earth and<br>
negative electrification of the clouds.<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Lightning, Globe or Globular.</span><br>
A very unusual form of lightning discharge, in which the flashes appear<br>
as globes or balls of light. They are sometimes visible for ten seconds,<br>
moving so slowly that the eye can follow them. They often rebound on<br>
striking the ground, and sometimes explode with a noise like a cannon.<br>
They have never been satisfactorily explained. Sometimes the phenomenon<br>
is probably subjective and due to persistence of vision.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Localization.</span><br>
Determining the position of anything, such as a break in a cable, or a<br>
grounding in a telegraph line. In ocean cables two typical cases are the<br>
localization of a break in the conductor and of a defect in the<br>

capacity of the portion of the line which includes the unbroken portion<br>
of the conductor; the other by determining the resistance of the line on<br>
a grounded circuit.<br>

Fig. 217. PLATE FRICTIONAL ELECTRIC MACHINE.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Machine, Frictional Electric.</span><br>
An apparatus for development of high tension electricity by contact<br>
action, brought about by friction.<br>
<br>
It consists of a plate or cylinder of glass mounted on insulating<br>
standards and provided with a handle for turning it. One or more<br>
cushions of leather are held on an insulated support, so as to rub<br>
against the plate or cylinder as it is turned. A metal comb or combs are<br>
held on another insulating support so as to be nearly in contact with<br>
the surface of the glass plate at a point as far removed as possible<br>
from the rubbers. The combs are attached to a brass ball or round-ended<br>
cylinder, which is termed the prime conductor.<br>
<br>
In use either the prime conductor or cushions are connected by a chain<br>
or otherwise with the earth. Assume it to be the cushions. As the<br>
machine is worked by turning the plate, the glass and cushion being in<br>
contact develop opposite electricities. The glass is charged with<br>
positive electricity, and as it turns carries it off and as it reaches<br>
the prime conductor by induction and conduction robs it of its negative<br>
electricity. Meanwhile the cushions negatively excited deliver their<br>
charge to the earth. The action thus goes on, the prime conductor being<br>
charged with positive electricity.<br>
<br>
<br>
334&nbsp;&nbsp; STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.<br>
<br>
<br>
If the prime conductor is connected to the earth and the cushions are<br>
left insulated, negative electricity can be collected from the cushions.<br>
<br>
In some machines both prime conductor and cushions are kept insulated<br>
and without ground contact. Electrodes connecting with each are brought<br>
with their ends close enough to maintain a sparking discharge.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Machine Influence.</span><br>
A static electric machine working by induction to build up charges of<br>
opposite nature on two separate prime conductors. In general they are<br>
based on the principle of the electrophorous. Work is done by the<br>
operator turning the handle. This rotates a disc and draws excited parts<br>
of it away from their bound charges. This represents a resistance to<br>
mechanical motion. The work absorbed in overcoming this mechanical<br>
resistance appears as electric energy. There are various types of<br>
influence machines, the Holtz, Toeppler-Holtz and Wimshurst being the<br>
most used. The electrophorous, q. v., is a type of influence machine.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Machine, Holtz Influence.</span><br>
A static electric machine. It includes two plates, one of which is<br>
rapidly rotated in front of the other. Two armatures of paper are<br>
secured to the back of the stationary plate at opposite ends of a<br>
diameter. To start it one of these is charged with electricity. This<br>
charge by induction acts through the two thicknesses of glass upon a<br>
metal bar carrying combs, which lies in front of the further side of the<br>
movable plate. The points opposite the armature repel electrified air,<br>
which strikes the movable disc and charges it. A second rod with comb at<br>
the opposite end of the same diameter acts in the reverse way. Thus<br>
opposite sections of the disc are oppositely charged and the combs with<br>
them. By induction these portions of the disc react upon the two<br>
armatures. The opposite electricities escape from the armatures by paper<br>
tongues which are attached thereto and press against the back of the<br>
movable plate. As the plate rotates the opposite electricities on its<br>
face neutralize the electricity repelled from the combs. The charges on<br>
the back strengthen the charges of the armatures and brass combs. Thus<br>
the machine builds up, and eventually a discharge of sparks takes place<br>
from the poles of the brass combs.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Machine, Toeppler-Holtz.</span><br>
A modification of the Holtz machine. The priming charge of the armatures<br>

the face of the rotating plate. (See Machine, Holtz.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Machine, Wimshurst.</span><br>
A form of static influence machine. It consists of two plates of glass,<br>
on which radial sectors of tinfoil are pasted. Both plates are rotated<br>
in opposite directions. The sectors of the two plates react one upon the<br>
other, and electric charges of opposite sign accumulate on the opposite<br>
sides of the plates and are collected therefrom by collecting combs.<br>

A name, derived from Maxwell, and suggested for the unit of inductance.<br>
It is due to Oliver Heaviside, but has never been adopted. (See Henry.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magne-Crystallic Action.</span><br>
The action of a supposed force of the same name, proposed by Faraday. It<br>
relates to the different action of a magnetic field upon crystalline<br>
bodies, according to the position of their axes of crystallization. A<br>
needle of tourmaline, normally paramagnetic, if poised with its axis<br>
horizontal, is diamagnetic. Bismuth illustrates the same phenomenon. The<br>
subject is obscure. Faraday thought that he saw in it the action of a<br>
specific force.<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnet.</span><br>
A body which tends when suspended by its centre of gravity to lay itself<br>
in a definite direction, and to place a definite line within it, its<br>
magnetic axis, q. v., in a definite direction, which, roughly speaking,<br>
lies north and south. The same bodies have the power of attracting iron<br>

A magnet possessing more than the normal number (two) of poles. If two<br>
straight magnets are placed end to end with their south poles in<br>
juxtaposition the compound bar will seem to possess three poles, one at<br>
each end and one in the middle. The apparent pole in the middle is<br>
really made up of two consequent poles, q. v. It sometimes happens that<br>
when a single long thin bar is magnetized consequent poles are produced,<br>
although such magnet is in one piece. This may be accidental, as in such<br>
case it is quite hard to avoid anomalous poles, or, as in the field<br>
magnets of some forms of dynamos, anomalous poles may be purposely<br>
produced.<br>

A form of permanent magnet used in some galvanometers. In shape it is a<br>

as to make it represent a horseshoe magnet. Its shape enables it to be<br>

A magnet attached to a galvanometer by which the directive tendency of<br>
its magnetic needle is adjusted. In the reflecting galvanometer it often<br>
is a slightly curved magnet carried by a vertical brass spindle rising<br>

A damping magnet is one used for bringing an oscillating body to rest.<br>
The body may be a metallic disc or needle, and the action of the magnet<br>

A magnet of U shape--properly one with the poles brought a little closer<br>
together than the rest of the limbs. For direct lifting and attractive<br>
effects it is the most generally adopted type. Its advantage as regards<br>
lifting effect is due to small reluctance, q. v., offered by a complete<br>
iron circuit, such as the armature and magnet together produce. As the<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnetic Adherence.</span><br>
The tendency of a mass of iron to adhere to the poles of a magnet. It is<br>

The line connecting the poles of a magnet. It does not generally<br>

error is introduced into the indications of the needle which must be<br>
determined and allowed for in compasses. To determine it with a magnetic<br>
needle the suspension cup is made removable, so that the needle can be<br>
reversed. Readings are taken with one side of the needle and then with<br>
the other side of the needle up, and the average corresponds with the<br>
position of the magnetic axis in both positions of the needle.<br>

A name for a compound permanent magnet; one made up by bolting or<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnetic Circuit.</span><br>
A magnetic field of force is characterized by the presence of lines of<br>
force, which, while approximately parallel, curve around and tend to<br>
form closed curves. The polarity of a field of force is referred to an<br>
imaginary direction of the lines of force from the north pole through<br>
space to the south pole, and in the part of the field corresponding to<br>
the body of the magnet, from the south to the north pole. The cut<br>
indicates these features. Hence the magnetic field of force is termed<br>
the magnetic circuit, and to it are attributed a species of resistance<br>
termed reluctance, q. v., and the producing cause of the field or lines<br>
of force is termed sometimes magneto-motive force, q. v.) corresponding<br>
to the electro-motive force. The modern treatment of the magnetic<br>
circuit is similar to the application of Ohm's law and the laws of<br>
resistance and conductivity to the electric circuit.<br>

paramagnetic substance only and is identical for permanent magnets or<br>
for electro-magnets. An air space intervening between armature and<br>

A break or gap in a magnetic circuit. To make a complete circuit the<br>

armature is not in contact magnetic continuity gives place to<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnetic Elements.</span><br>
The qualities of the terrestrial magnetism at any place as expressed in<br>
its action upon the magnetic needle. Three data are involved.<br>
<br>
I. The Declination or Variation.<br>
II. The Inclination or Dip.<br>
III. The Force or Intensity.<br>
<br>
I. The Declination is the variation expressed in angular degrees of the<br>
magnetic needle from the true north and south, or is the angle which the<br>
plane of the magnetic meridian makes with that of the geographical<br>
meridian. It is expressed as east or west variation according to the<br>
position of the north pole; east when the north pole of the needle is to<br>
the east of the true meridian, and vice versa. Declination is different<br>
for different places; it is at present west in Europe and Africa, and<br>
east in Asia and the greater part of North and South America. The<br>
declination is subject to (a) secular, (b) annual and (c) diurnal<br>
variations. These are classed as regular; others due to magnetic storms<br>
are transitory and are classed as irregular, (a) Secular variations. The<br>
following table shows the secular variations during some three hundred<br>
years at Paris. These changes are termed secular, because they require<br>
centuries for their completion.<br>

<br>
On scrutinizing these figures it will be seen that there is part of a<br>
cycle represented and that the declination is slowly returning to the<br>
zero point after having reached its maximum western variation in 1814.<br>
Upwards of 300 years would be required for its completion on the basis<br>
of what is known. In other places, notably the coast of Newfoundland,<br>
the Gulf of the St. Lawrence and the rest of the North American seaboard<br>
and in the British Channel, the secular variations are much more rapid<br>
in progress. (b) Annual variations--These were first discovered in 1780<br>
by Cassini. They represent a cycle of annual change of small extent,<br>
from 15' to 18' only. In Paris and London the annual variation is<br>
greatest about the vernal equinox, or March 21st, and diminishes for the<br>
next three months, and slowly increases again during the nine following<br>
months. It varies during different epochs. (c) Diurnal variations were<br>
discovered in 1722 by Graham. A long needle has to be employed, or the<br>
reflection of a ray of light, as in the reflecting galvanometer, has to<br>
be used to observe them. In England the north pole of the magnetic<br>
needle moves every day from east to west from sunrise until 1 or 2 P.<br>
M.; it then tends towards the east and recovers its original position by<br>
10 P. M. During the night the needle is almost stationary. As regards<br>
range the mean amplitude of diurnal variations at Paris is from April to<br>
September 13' to 15'; for the other months from 8' to 10'. On some days<br>
it amounts to 25' and sometimes is no more than 5'. The amplitude of<br>
diurnal variations decreases from the poles to the equator. Irregular<br>
variations accompany earthquakes, the aurora borealis and volcanic<br>
eruptions. In Polar regions the auroral variations may be very great;<br>
even at 40&deg; latitude they may be 1&deg; or 2&deg;. Simultaneous
irregularities<br>
sometimes extend over large areas. Such are attributed to magnetic<br>
storms. II. The Inclination is the angle which the magnetic needle makes<br>
with the horizon, when the vertical plane in which the needle is assumed<br>
to be free to move coincides with the magnetic meridian. It is sometimes<br>
called the dip of the needle. It varies as does the declination, as<br>
shown in the following table of inclinations of London.<br>

III. Force or Intensity is the directive force of the earth. It varies<br>
with the squares of the number of oscillations the magnetic needle will<br>
make if caused to oscillate from a determined initial range. The<br>
intensity is supposed to be subject to secular change. According to<br>
Gauss the total magnetic intensity of the earth is equal to that which<br>
would be exerted if in each cubic yard there were eight bar magnets,<br>
each weighing one pound. This is, of course, a rough way of expressing<br>
the degree of intensity. Intensity is least near the magnetic equator<br>
and greatest near the magnetic poles; the places of maximum intensity<br>
are termed the magnetic foci. It varies with the time of day and<br>
possibly with changes in altitude.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnetic Elongation.</span><br>
The elongation a bar of iron or steel undergoes when magnetized. By<br>
magnetization it becomes a little longer and thinner, there being no<br>
perceptible change in volume. The change is accompanied by a slight<br>
sound--the magnetic tick. An exceedingly delicate adjustment of<br>
apparatus is required for its observation.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnetic Equator.</span><br>
A locus of the earth's surface where the magnet has no tendency to dip.<br>
It is, approximately speaking, a line equally distant from the magnetic<br>
poles, and is called also the aclinic line. It is not a great circle of<br>
the earth.<br>

<br>
345&nbsp; STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnetic Field of Force.</span><br>
The field of force established by a magnet pole. The attractions and<br>
repulsions exercised by such a field follow the course of the electro-<br>
magnetic lines of force. (See also Field of Force.) Thus the tendency of<br>
a polarized needle attracted or repelled is to follow, always keeping<br>
tangential to curved lines, the direction of the lines of force, however<br>
sweeping they may be. The direction of magnetic lines of force is<br>
assumed to be the direction in which a positive pole is repelled or a<br>
negative one attracted; in other words, from the north pole of a magnet<br>
to its south pole in the outer circuit. The direction of lines of force<br>
at any point, and the intensity or strength of the field at that point,<br>
express the conditions there. The intensity may bc expressed in terms of<br>
that which a unit pole at unit distance would produce. This intensity as<br>
unitary it has been proposed to term a Gauss. (See Weber.)<br>
<br>
The direction of the lines of force in a magnetic field are shown by the<br>
time-honored experiment of sprinkling filings of iron upon a sheet of<br>
paper held over a magnet pole or poles. They arrange themselves, if the<br>
paper is tapped, in more or less curved lines tending to reach from one<br>
pole of the magnet to the other. Many figures may be produced by<br>
different conditions. Two near poles of like name produce lines of force<br>
which repel each other. (See Magnetic Curves.)<br>
<br>
A magnetic and an electro-magnetic field are identical in all essential<br>
respects; the magnetic field may be regarded as a special form of the<br>
electro-magnetic field, but only special as regards its production and<br>
its defined north and south polar regions.<br>
<br>
Synonyms--Magnetic Spin (not much used).<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnetic Field, Uniform.</span><br>
A field of identical strength in all parts, such as the earth's magnetic<br>
field. If artificially produced, which can only be approximately done,<br>
it implies large cross-section of magnet pole in proportion to the<br>
length of the magnetic needle affected by it, which is used in<br>
determining its uniformity.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnetic Figures.</span><br>
The figures produced by iron filings upon paper or glass held near<br>
magnetic poles. By these figures the direction of lines of force is<br>
approximately given, and a species of map of the field is shown. (See<br>
Magnetic Field of Force--Magnetic Curves.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnetic Filament.</span><br>
The successive rows of polarized molecules assumed to exist in<br>
magnetized iron. Each molecule represents an infinitely small magnet,<br>
and its north pole points to the south pole of the next molecule. Such a<br>
string or row is a theoretical conception based on the idea that the<br>
molecules in a magnet are all swung in to parallelism in the magnetizing<br>
process. A magnetic filament may be termed the longitudinal element of a<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnetic Fluids.</span><br>
A two-fluid theory of magnetism has been evolved, analogous to the<br>
two-fluid theory of electricity. It assumes north fluid or "red<br>
magnetism" and a south fluid or "blue magnetism." Each magnetism is<br>
supposed to predominate at its own pole and to attract its opposite.<br>
Before magnetization the fluids are supposed to neutralize each other<br>
about each molecule; magnetization is assumed to separate them,<br>
accumulating quantities of them at the poles.<br>

The forces of attraction and repulsion exercised by a magnet. By<br>
Ampere's theory it is identical with the forces of attraction and<br>
repulsion of electric currents.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnetic Friction.</span><br>
The damping effect produced on the movements of a mass of metal by<br>
proximity to a magnet; the phenomenon illustrated in Arago's wheel, q.<br>
v. When a mass of metal moves in the vicinity of a magnet it cuts the<br>
lines of force emanating from its poles, thereby producing currents in<br>
its mass; as the production of these currents absorbs energy a damping<br>
effect is produced upon the movements of the mass.<br>
<br>

<br>

<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnetic Induction.</span><br>
The force of magnetization within an induced magnet. It is in part due<br>
to the action of the surrounding particles of polarized material; in<br>
part to the magnetic field. (See Magnetic Induction, Coefficient of.)<br>
<br>
In a more general way it is the action of a magnet upon bodies in its<br>
field of force. In some cases the magnetism induced causes the north<br>
pole of the induced magnet to place itself as far as possible from the<br>
north pole of the inducing magnet and the same for the south poles. Such<br>
substances are called paramagnetic or ferromagnetic. They lie parallel<br>
or tangential to the lines of force. In other cases the bodies lie at<br>
right angles or normal to the lines of force. Such bodies are called<br>
diamagnetic.<br>
<br>
Some bodies are crystalline or not homogeneous in structure, and in them<br>
the lines of magnetic induction may take irregular or eccentric paths.<br>

<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnetic Induction, Apparent
Coefficient of.</span><br>
The apparent permeability of a paramagnetic body as affected by the<br>
presence of Foucault currents in the material itself. These currents act<br>
exactly as do the currents in the coils surrounding the cores of<br>
electro-magnets. They produce lines of force which may exhaust the<br>
permeability of the iron, or may, if in an opposite direction, add to<br>
its apparent permeability.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnetic Induction, Coefficient of.</span><br>
The number, obtained by dividing the magnetization of a body, expressed<br>
in lines of force produced in it, by the magnetizing force which has<br>
produced such magnetization, expressed in lines of force producible by<br>
the force in question in air. It always exceeds unity for iron, nickel<br>
and cobalt. It is also obtained by multiplying the coefficient of<br>
induced magnetization by 4 PI (4 * 3.14159) and adding 1. (See Magnetic<br>
Susceptibility--Magnetization, Coefficient of Induced.)<br>
<br>
<br>
347&nbsp;&nbsp; STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.<br>
<br>
<br>
The coefficient of magnetic induction varies with the material of the<br>
induced mass, and varies with the intensity of the magnetizing force.<br>
This variation is due to the fact that as the induced magnetism in a<br>
body increases, the magnetizing force required to maintain such<br>
induction, increases in a more rapid ratio. The coefficient of magnetic<br>
induction is the same as magnetic permeability, and in a certain sense<br>
is the analogue of conductivity. It is also termed the multiplying power<br>
of the body or core magnetized. It is the coefficient of induced<br>
magnetization (see Magnetization, Coefficient of Induced) referred to a<br>
mass of matter. For diamagnetic bodies the coefficient has a negative<br>
sign; for paramagnetic bodies it has a positive sign.<br>
<br>

<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnetic Induction, Dynamic.</span><br>
The induction produced by a magnetic field which moves with respect to a<br>
body, or where the body if moving moves at a different rate, or where<br>
the body moves and the field is stationary. In the case where both move,<br>
part of the induction may be dynamic and part static. (See Magnetic<br>
Induction, Static.)<br>

<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnetic Induction, Tube of.</span><br>
An approximate cylinder or frustrum of a cone whose sides are formed of<br>
lines of magnetic induction. (See Magnetic Induction, Lines of.) The<br>
term tube is very curiously applied in this case, because the element or<br>
portion of a magnetic field thus designated is in no sense hollow or<br>
tubular.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnetic Inertia.</span><br>
A sensible time is required to magnetize iron, or for it to part with<br>
its magnetism, however soft it may be. This is due to its magnetic<br>
inertia and is termed the lag. Permanent or residual magnetism is a<br>
phase of it. It is analogous to self-induction of an electric circuit,<br>
or to the residual capacity of a dielectric.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnetic Insulation.</span><br>
Only approximate insulation of magnetism is possible. There is no<br>
perfect insulator. The best ones are only 10,000 times less permeable<br>
than iron. Hence lines of force find their way through air and all other<br>
substance, being simply crowded together more in paths of iron or other<br>
paramagnetic substance.<br>
<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnetic Intensity.</span><br>
The intensity of the magnetization of a body. It is measured by the<br>
magnetic lines of force passing through a unit area of the body, such<br>
area being at right angles to the direction of the lines of force.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnetic Lag.</span><br>
In magnetism the tendency of hard iron or steel especially to take up<br>
magnetism slowly, and to part with it slowly. (See Magnetic Inertia.)<br>
The lag affects the action of a dynamo, and is a minor cause of those<br>
necessitating the lead of the brushes.<br>
<br>
Synonym--Magnetic Retardation.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnetic Latitude.</span><br>
Latitude referred to the magnetic equator and isoclinic lines.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnetic Leakage.</span><br>
The lines of force in a field magnet which pass through the air and not<br>
through the armature are useless and represent a waste of field. Such<br>
lines constitute magnetic leakage.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnetic Limit.</span><br>
The temperature beyond which a paramagnetic metal cannot be magnetized.<br>
The magnetic limit of iron is from a red to a white heat; of cobalt, far<br>
beyond a white heat; of chromium, below a red heat; of nickel at about<br>
350&deg; C. (662&deg;F.) of manganese, from 15&deg; C. to 20&deg; C.

<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnetic Lines of Force.</span><br>
Lines of force indicating the distribution of magnetic force, which is<br>
due presumably to whirls of the ether. A wire or conductor through which<br>
a current is passing is surrounded by an electro-magnetic field of<br>
force, q. v., whose lines of force form circles surrounding the<br>
conductor in question. A magnet marks the existence of a similar<br>
electro-magnetic field of force whose lines form circuits comprising<br>
part of and in some places all of the body of the magnet, and which are<br>
completed through the air or any surrounding paramagnetic or diamagnetic<br>
body. They may be thought of as formed by the Amp&eacute;rian sheet of
current,<br>
and analogous to those just mentioned as surrounding a conductor.<br>

Imaginary matter assumed as a cause of magnetism. Two kinds, one<br>
positive and one negative, may be assumed as in the two fluid theory of<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnetic Meridian.</span><br>
A line formed on the earth's surface by the intersection therewith of a<br>

Lines. These lines mark the places of the intersection of equipotential<br>
surfaces with the earth's surface. They are not true circles, and near<br>

The points where the equipotential surfaces of the terrestrial field of<br>
force graze the earth's surface; the points toward which the north or<br>
south poles of the magnetic needle is attracted. Over a magnetic pole<br>
the magnetic needle tends to stand in a vertical position. There are two<br>
poles, Arctic or negative, and Antarctic or positive. Magnetic needles<br>
surrounding them do not necessarily point toward them, as they point to<br>
the centres of curvature of their respective magnetic parallels. The<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnetic Proof Plane.</span><br>
An exploring coil used for testing the distribution of magnetism. It is<br>
connected in circuit with a galvanometer, and exposed to alternation of<br>
current, or to other disturbing action produced by the magnet or field<br>
under examination. This affects the galvanometer, and from its movements<br>
the current produced in the coil, and thence the magnetic induction to<br>
which it was exposed, are calculated.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnetic Quantity.</span><br>
The magnetism possessed by a body; it is proportional to the action of<br>
similar poles upon each other, or to the field produced by the pole in<br>
question. It is also called the strength of a pole.<br>
<br>
The force exercised by two similar poles upon each other varies with<br>
their product and inversely with the square of the distance separating<br>
them; or it may be expressed thus (m * m) / (L^2). This is a force, and<br>
the dimensions of a force are ML/(T^2). Therefore, (m^2)/(L^2) =<br>
ML/(T^2) or m = (M^.5)*(L^1.5)/T.<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnetic Rotary Polarization.</span><br>
If a plane polarized beam of light is sent through a transparent medium<br>
in a magnetic field its plane of polarization is rotated, and this<br>
phenomenon is denoted as above. (Compare Refraction, Electric, and see<br>
Electro-magnetic Stress.) This has been made the basis of a method for<br>
measuring current. A field of force varies with the current; the<br>
polarization produced by such field is therefore proportional to the<br>
current. (Becquerel &amp; Rayleigh.)<br>
<br>
A plane polarized beam of light passing through the transparent medium<br>
in the magnetic field by the retardation or acceleration of one of its<br>
circular components has its plane of polarization rotated as described.<br>
The direction of the lines of force and the nature of the medium<br>
determine the sense of the rotation; the amount depends upon the<br>
intensity of the field resolved in the direction of the ray, and on the<br>
thickness and nature of the medium.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnetic Saturation.</span><br>
The maximum magnetic force which can be permanently imparted to a steel<br>
bar. A bar may be magnetized beyond this point, but soon sinks to it.<br>
The magnetism produced in a bar is prevented from depolarization by the<br>
retentivity or coercive force of the bar. The higher the degree of<br>
magnetization the greater the tendency to depolarization.<br>
<br>
It is also defined as the maximum intensity of magnetism produced in a<br>
paramagnetic substance by a magnetic field as far as affected by the<br>
permeability of the substance in question. The more lines of force<br>
passed through such a substance the lower is its residual permeability.<br>
It is assumed that this becomes zero after a certain point, and then the<br>
point of saturation is reached. After this point is reached the addition<br>
of any lines of force is referred entirely to the field and not at all<br>
to the permeability of the substance. But such a zero is only definable<br>
approximately.<br>

to a great extent keep within the metal of the box on account of its<br>
permeability, and but a comparatively few of them cross the space within<br>
it.<br>

Such screens are used to prevent watches from being magnetized, and are<br>

An apparatus for separating magnetic substances from mixtures. Such<br>

A theoretical conception of a cause of a magnetic field or of a<br>
distribution of magnetism. If we imagine a quantity of very short<br>
magnets arranged in contact with their like poles all pointing in the<br>
same direction so as to make a metal sheet, we have a magnetic shell.<br>
Its magnetic moment is equal to the sum of the magnetic moment of all<br>
its parts. If the shell is of uniform strength the magnetic moment of a<br>
unit area gives the strength of the shell; it is equal to the magnetic<br>
quantity per unit of area, multiplied by the thickness of the shell.<br>
<br>
If its strength is uniform throughout a magnetic shell is called simple;<br>
if its strength varies it is termed complex.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnetic Shunt.</span><br>
The conception of a magnetic circuit being formed, the shunt is a<br>
corollary of the theory. It is any piece of iron which connects points<br>
of a magnet differing in polarity, so as to divert part of the lines of<br>
force from the armature or yoke. The shunt is especially applicable in<br>
the case of horseshoe magnets. Thus a bar of iron placed across from<br>
limb to limb a short distance back from the poles would act as a shunt<br>
to the armature and would divert to itself part of the lines of force<br>
which would otherwise go through the armature and would weaken the<br>
attraction of the magnet for the latter. In dynamos a bar of iron used<br>
as a magnetic shunt has been used to diminish the lines of force going<br>
through the armature and hence to weaken the field and diminish the<br>
electro-motive force. By moving the shunt nearer or further from the<br>
poles the dynamo is regulated.<br>
<br>
In the cut the projections between the yoke and poles of the magnet<br>
shown act as a shunt to the yoke, taking some lines of force therefrom.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnetism, Amp&eacute;re's Theory of.</span><br>
A theory accounting for magnetic phenomena by assuming the existence of<br>
currents circulating around the molecules of permanent magnets. If such<br>
currents so circulate and all in the same direction, the result is the<br>
same as if the body of the magnet was enveloped in currents representing<br>
those of an electro-magnet or solenoid. This is because in the interior<br>
the current around one molecule would counteract the current around its<br>
neighboring ones in part, so that the only virtual currents left would<br>
be represented by those on the outer surfaces of the outer shell of<br>
molecules, and these virtually resolve themselves into one general<br>
current sheet, surrounding the magnet and coinciding with its surface.<br>
<br>
The theory assumes that such currents permanently circulate around the<br>
molecules of paramagnetic substances. Under ordinary conditions there is<br>
no coincidence in their direction and no resultant current is produced.<br>
When magnetized or polarized the molecules are brought into order, so<br>
that the direction of their current coincides and the body becomes a<br>
magnet.<br>

<br>
<br>
At the north pole of the magnet the direction of the Amp&eacute;rian
currents<br>
is the reverse of that of a watch when the observer faces the pole; the<br>
reverse obtains for the south pole.<br>
<br>
The attraction of opposite and repulsion of similar poles is explained<br>
by the actions of the Amp&eacute;rian currents upon each other. If
north and<br>
south pole are placed together these currents will coincide in direction<br>
and hence will attract each other. If two like poles are put together<br>
the currents will have opposite directions and will repel each other.<br>
<br>
No energy is supposed to be required to maintain currents around or in a<br>
single molecule.<br>

A term arising from the two fluid theory of magnetism; the magnetism of<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnetism, Components of Earth's.</span><br>
The magnetic force of the earth acts in the plane of the magnetic<br>
meridian and in direction generally lies oblique to the plane of the<br>
horizon. It can be resolved into two components, one vertical, which has<br>
no directive effect upon the magnetic needle, the other horizontal,<br>
which represents the directive element for the usual compass needle. For<br>
the dipping needle, q. v., the vertical component is the only active<br>
one. A magnetic needle mounted on a universal joint at its centre of<br>
gravity would be acted on by both components.<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnetism, Creeping of.</span><br>
The gradual increase of magnetism when a magnetic force is applied with<br>
absolute steadiness to a piece of iron. It is a form of magnetic lag. It<br>
may last for half an hour and involve an increase of several per cent.<br>
of the total magnetism.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnetism, Decay of.</span><br>
The gradual loss of magnetism by permanent magnets, due to accidental<br>
shocks, changes of temperature, slow spontaneous annealing of the iron<br>
and other similar causes.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnetism, Discharge of.</span><br>
The loosing of magnetization. Thus in a shunt-wound dynamo there is a<br>
critical resistance for the outer circuit, below which the field ceases<br>
to be magnetized, as enough current ceases to be shunted into it to<br>
magnetize it. The machine is said to unbuild itself, and a discharge of<br>
magnetism occurs from the field magnet.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnetism, Ewing's Theory of.</span><br>
Ewing found by a model consisting of a number of pivoted magnetic<br>
needles that the observed phenomena of magnetization could be<br>
represented thereby. Thus there would be no need of assuming internal<br>
frictional forces of Maxwell, nor the closed rings or chains of Hughes.<br>
The theory retains the notion, however, of paramagnetic matter,<br>
consisting of an assemblage of molecular magnets. The loss of energy by<br>
hysteresis is represented in the model by the energy lost by the needles<br>
in beating against the air.<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnetism, Free.</span><br>
The magnetism or magnetic field outside of a magnetic circuit. It is due<br>
to escape of lines of force and to the magnetic leakage through the air.<br>
The lines of force are never, under the most favorable circumstances,<br>
confined to the metallic circuit of the magnet and armature. In a simple<br>
magnet without armature all the lines of force have to follow an air<br>
path, and the field is at its strongest. As the magnetism is strongest<br>
at the surface near the poles, the term is sometimes understood as<br>
applying to the surface attraction. In such case it is defined as the<br>
distribution, on a magnetized bar or mass, of magnetic lines of force as<br>
they emerge from its surface.<br>
<br>
Synonym--Surface Magnetization.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnetism, Hughes' Theory of.</span><br>
A theory accounting for magnetic phenomena by assuming that each<br>
molecule is a magnet, and that in a polarized or magnetized body they<br>
are all arranged with their poles in the same direction, while in an<br>
unmagnetized body their poles, alternating in direction, neutralize each<br>
other.<br>
<br>
Magnetization consists in a partial rotation of the molecules so as to<br>
make them agree in position, thus, as a resultant developing north and<br>
south poles at the ends of the bar.<br>
<br>
The theory is in a certain sense simpler than Ampere's theory, but is<br>
not so generally adopted.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnetism, Lamellar Distribution of.</span><br>
The distribution of magnetism in thin and uniform or "simple magnetic<br>
shells," q. v. A given distribution is termed lamellar if the substance<br>
in which it exists can be divided into simple magnetic shells, which<br>
either form closed surfaces, or have their edges in the surface of the<br>
substance. In lamellar distribution the polar area is very large<br>
compared with the distance between opposite poles.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnetism of Gases.</span><br>
Faraday experimented on this point by coloring gases with a little vapor<br>
of iodine or other colored gas, and letting them flow between the two<br>
poles of a powerful electromagnet. In this way he found some are<br>
repelled, some attracted, and in the case of oxygen, it is attracted at<br>
one temperature and repelled at another. At ordinary temperatures a<br>
cubic yard of oxygen possesses the magnetism of 5.5 grains of iron and<br>
when liquefied it is strongly attracted.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnetism or Magnetization, Temporary.</span><br>
When a mass of iron is magnetized by a current, when the current ceases<br>
the portion of its magnetism which disappears is the temporary<br>
magnetism; the portion retained is the residual or permanent magnetism.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnetism, Red.</span><br>
A term arising from the two fluid theory of magnetism; the magnetism of<br>

The residual magnetism left in a bar of steel or other paramagnetic<br>
material after the application of a powerful magnet. It is distinguished<br>
from coercive force, as the latter is the amount of negative magnetizing<br>
or of demagnetizing force required to reduce the remanent magnetism to<br>
zero.<br>

<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnetism Sub-permanent.</span><br>
The magnetism of a paramagnetic substance which presents a considerable<br>
degree of permanency, but which gradually disappears, leaving the<br>
permanent magnetism present. It is noticeable in iron or steel ships<br>
whose magnetism gradually reduced in quantity, eventually becomes fully<br>
permanent.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnetism, Weber's Theory of.</span><br>
The molecules of a magnetizable material by this theory are supposed to<br>
be magnets with their poles lying in every direction, and hence<br>
neutralizing each other. By magnetization these are supposed to be<br>
turned with their similar poles in the same direction, and their axis<br>
parallel, hence acting like a group of magnets. It is practically<br>
identical with Hughes' theory.<br>

Fig. 228. MAGNETIZATION BY DOUBLE TOUCH.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnetization by Double Touch.</span><br>
The process of magnetizing a steel bar by simultaneously stroking it<br>
with two poles of a horseshoe magnet or with two opposite poles of two<br>
bar magnets. The poles must be close but not touching. A block of wood<br>
may be placed between the ends if single magnets are used. The poles are<br>
placed on the middle of the bar and carried back and forth to one end,<br>
then to the other, and so on, ending at the middle of the bar in such<br>
direction as to give each end the same number of strokes. The poles must<br>
be close together or consequent poles will be produced. If bar magnets<br>
are used they may be held inclined at an angle of 15&ordm; to 20&ordm;
with the<br>
horizontal bar to be magnetized. The ends of the latter may rest on<br>
poles of two other magnets, each end on a pole of the same name as that<br>
of the magnetizing magnet on its side. (See Magnetization, Hoffer's<br>
Method.)<br>
<br>
<br>
359&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnetization by Separate Touch.</span><br>
A method of magnetization. Two magnets are used. Held in an inclined<br>
position two opposite poles are touched to the bar near its centre, and<br>
are drawn off to the two ends. They are returned through the air and the<br>
process is repeated.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnetization by Single Touch.</span><br>
A method of polarizing or magnetizing steel bars, by stroking them<br>
always in one direction with one pole of a magnet, returning it through<br>
the air. The stroking is best done on both sides. The stroking may begin<br>
at one end and end at the other, or it may be commenced in the center of<br>
the bar and be carried to one end with one pole, and the same done for<br>
the other half with the other pole.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnetization by the Earth.</span><br>
The earth imparts magnetism to iron masses. If a rod of steel is held<br>
parallel to the inclination and in the magnetic meridian it exhibits<br>
polarity, which by jarring or hammering, can be made to some extent<br>
permanent. A piece of soft iron held vertically, or still better in the<br>
line of the dip as above, and which is twisted when in that position,<br>
becomes magnetized with some degree of permanence. Many other instances<br>
are cited, such as fire-irons, lamp-posts, iron gates, lathe turnings,<br>
all of which often exhibit polarity, having been magnetized by the<br>
earth's field.<br>
<br>
[Transcriber's note: The earth's magnetic field is believed to originate<br>
it electric currents in the moving molten core.]<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnetization, Coefficient of Induced.</span><br>
The coefficient (q. v.) expressing the relation between the specific<br>
intensity of magnetization of a particle and the magnetizing force. The<br>
magnetizing force is measured by the lines of force it can produce in a<br>
field of air. The coefficient of induced magnetization is the factor by<br>
which the intensity of a magnetizing field must be multiplied to produce<br>
the magnetization imparted by it to a particle of any substance. This<br>
coefficient varies for different substances, and is also called magnetic<br>
susceptibility. It is distinguished from permeability as referring only<br>
to a particle isolated from influence of a mass of surrounding particles<br>
of its own kind. It is definable as the intensity of the magnetization<br>
assumed by an exceedingly long and exceedingly thin bar placed in a unit<br>
field. If a mass of metal were placed in such a field all its particles<br>
would become affected and within the mass no unit field could exist.<br>
Hence magnetic susceptibility (another name for this coefficient) does<br>
not apply to the case of large cores of electro-magnets and<br>
dynamo-armatures, but is really a theoretical rather than a practical<br>
figure.<br>
<br>
The sign of the coefficient of diamagnetic bodies is negative; of<br>
paramagnetic bodies is positive.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnetization, Cycle of.</span><br>
A cycle of positive or of positive and negative magnetization represents<br>
the application of a magnetizing force beginning at a fixed value,<br>
generally zero, rising to a maximum, or to a value of maximum distance<br>
from the initial and then returning to the original basis. It is<br>
virtually a full wave of magnetization and may extend on both sides of a<br>
zero line giving positive and negative values.<br>

Cycles of magnetization apply especially to transformers and other<br>
apparatus of that character used with the alternating current system.<br>

<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnetization, Hoffer's Method.</span><br>
For horseshoe bars an armature is placed against the poles of the magnet<br>
bar to be treated. The poles of a strong horseshoe magnet are stroked<br>
over it from poles to bend and returned through the air, or vice versa.<br>
In the first case the poles will be the same as those of the inducing<br>
magnet; in the second case they will be opposite. A maximum effect is<br>
produced in ten strokes. The stroking should be applied to both sides.<br>
An electro-magnet may be used as inducer as shown, but an armature<br>
should be used; in the cut it is omitted.<br>

The determination of the magnetic moment of a magnet.<br>

It involves the determination by experiment of--( a) the product of the<br>

M*H is determined by the method of vibrations. A very long, thin magnet<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magneto-motive Force.</span><br>
The force producing a magnetic field or forcing lines of force around a<br>
magnetic circuit. It is usually applied only to electro-magnets and is<br>
expressible in turns of the wire winding multiplied by amperes of<br>
current, or in ampere-turns.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnet Operation.</span><br>
A term in surgery; the use of the electro-magnet or permanent magnet for<br>
removing particles of iron from the eye.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnetoscope.</span><br>
An apparatus for detecting the presence of magnetism, without measuring<br>
its intensity. A simple magneto-scope consists of a magnetized bit of<br>
watch-spring suspended in a vertical glass tube by a fine filament. A<br>
bit of unmagnetized soft iron wire may be used in the same way. The<br>
first has the advantage of indicating polarity; the latter merely shows<br>
magnetic attraction. A cork may be used as base of the instrument.<br>

366&nbsp;&nbsp; STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnet, Permanent.</span><br>
A bar of steel charged with residual magnetism. Steel possesses high<br>
coercive force in virtue of which when once magnetized it retains part<br>
of the magnetization.<br>
<br>
Permanent magnets are generally straight bars or U shaped; they are<br>
termed bar magnets, magnetic needles, horseshoe magnets, machine magnets<br>
and otherwise, according to their shape or uses.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnet Pole.</span><br>
The part of a magnet showing strongest polarity; the part which attracts<br>
iron the most powerfully, and acts as the starting point for lines of<br>
force.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnet Poles, Secondary.</span><br>
Magnet poles are often not situated at the ends. Owing to inequality of<br>
the material or other causes they may occupy intermediate positions on<br>
the magnet. Such poles are called secondary poles.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnet Pole, Unit.</span><br>
A unit magnet pole is one which exerts unit force on another unit pole<br>
placed at unit distance from it. Unit force is the dyne; unit distance<br>
is one centimeter.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnet, Portative Power of.</span><br>
The power of sustaining a weight by attraction of its armature possessed<br>
by a magnet. In general terms the adherence of the armature of a magnet<br>
to the pole varies with the square of the number of lines of force which<br>
pass through the point of contact. Hence an increased adherence of the<br>
armature to a horseshoe electro-magnet is sometimes obtained by<br>
diminishing the area of contact of one pole which concentrates the lines<br>
of force. Steel magnets were frequently made with rounded ends to<br>
increase the portative power.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnet, Simple.</span><br>
A magnet made of one piece of metal, or at least magnetized as such; the<br>
reverse of a compound magnet, which is magnetized piece by piece and<br>
then fastened together.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnet, Solenoidal.</span><br>
A magnet which is so uniformly magnetized and is so long in proportion<br>
to its other dimensions that it virtually establishes two magnetic<br>
poles, one at either end. It is a long thin bar so magnetized that all<br>
its molecules would, considered as magnets, be absolutely equal.<br>
(Daniell.) It acts like a solenoid, except that it is longer in<br>
proportion than the solenoid generally is constructed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnet, Sucking.</span><br>
A magnet coil with movable or loose axial bar of soft iron.<br>
<br>
The whole is usually mounted vertically. When a strong enough current is<br>
passed the bar is drawn up into the coil as if by suction, whence the<br>
name.<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnet, Unipolar.</span><br>
No such thing as a unipolar magnet is possible. The name is given to<br>
poised or suspended magnets, one of whose poles lies in the axis of<br>
suspension. It is obvious that such a magnet will act, as far as its<br>
directive tendency and rotatory movements are concerned, as if it had<br>
only one pole. As shown in the cut, the pole s in both magnets lies in<br>
the axis of suspension or directly under the filament by which they are<br>
suspended, while the other pole n is the active pole in causing rotation<br>
or directive tendency; c c are counterweights or counterpoises.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnetophone.</span><br>
An apparatus for producing a loud sound, involving the principles of the<br>
telephone. A rapidly alternating or make and break current being<br>
produced by any means and being transmitted through the telephone gives<br>
a loud note of pitch dependent on the current producing it. Sometimes a<br>
perforated metallic disc is rotated in a magnetic field, and produces<br>
the requisite type of current.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Magnus' Law.</span><br>
A law of thermo-electricity. In a homogeneous circuit, however, the<br>
temperature varies from point to point; there is no current.<br>
<br>
Whatever potential differences may be established by the variations in<br>
temperature it is evident that they must counteract each other and<br>
reduce to zero.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Mains, Electric.</span><br>
The larger conductors in a system of electric light or power<br>
distribution.<br>
<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Make. v.</span><br>
To complete a circuit, as by closing a switch.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Make and Break Current.</span><br>
A current which is continually broken or interrupted and started again.<br>
It is applied only where the "makes" and "breaks" succeed each other<br>
with great rapidity, as in the action of an induction coil or pole<br>
changer, etc. It has had considerable importance in litigation affecting<br>
the Bell telephone patents, the courts holding that the original Bell<br>
patent (No. 174,465, of 1876,) covered the undulating current, for the<br>
transmission of speech. Many efforts have been made by litigants to<br>
prove that specific telephones have transmitted articulate speech by the<br>
make and break current, but without success. If this could have been<br>
proved the assumption is that the courts would have sustained the use of<br>
such device as not infringing upon the claims of the Bell patent.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Malapterurus.</span><br>
A fish, sometimes called the thunder fish, an inhabitant of African<br>
rivers, occurring in the Nile and Senegal. It possesses considerable<br>
electric power, similar to that of the gymnotus and torpedo, although<br>
inferior in amount.<br>

The cistern-like depression in the ground for giving access to the ends<br>
of tubes in electric conduits. (See Conduit, Electric Subway.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Marked End or Pole.</span><br>
The north pole or north seeking pole of a magnet, so called because it<br>
is usually marked with a notch or scratch by the maker. The south pole<br>
is called the unmarked end.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Mass.</span><br>
The quantity of matter in a body. The C. G. S. unit of mass is the<br>
quantity of matter in a gram. While weight varies with latitude and<br>
other circumstances, mass is invariable.<br>
<br>
The unit of mass is also defined as the quantity of matter which in a<br>
balance will counterpoise a standard mass, the gram or pound. As the<br>
gram is intended to be the mass of one cubic centimeter of water at<br>
3.09&ordm; C. (39&ordm; F.), the C. G. S. unit of mass is really
1.000013 gram.<br>
<br>
As a primary unit its dimensions are indicated by M.<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Mass, Electric.</span><br>
A term for quantity of electricity. The unit mass is such a quantity as<br>

<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Matter, Electric.</span><br>
The imaginary substance constituting electricity; a conception used<br>
purely as a matter of convenience.<br>
<br>
[Transcriber's note: The electron was discovered five years after this<br>
publication.]<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Matter, Radiant.</span><br>
Matter in the ultra-gaseous or so-called fourth state. In the gaseous<br>
state the molecules of a gas are in perpetual kinetic motion, colliding<br>
actually or virtually with each other, rebounding from such approach,<br>
and striking also the walls of the containing vessel. But except for<br>
these deflections, which are of enormous frequency, the paths of the<br>
molecules would be perfectly straight.<br>
<br>
In the radiant state matter exists in so high a vacuum that collisions<br>
of the molecules rarely occur, and the molecules simply beat back and<br>
forth in straight lines from side to side of the containing vessel.<br>
<br>
A layer of gas in this condition is termed a Crookes' layer, from Prof.<br>
William Crookes, who discovered and investigated these phenomena.<br>
<br>
<br>
369&nbsp;&nbsp; STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.<br>
<br>
<br>
Luminous streams of the molecules are produced by electric high<br>
potential discharges between electrodes. The course of the discharge is<br>
normal, in general terms, to the surfaces of the electrodes, and reaches<br>
from one to the other in a curve or straight line, as the case may be.<br>
<br>
These luminous streams are deflected by a magnetic field; if brought to<br>
a focus can heat refractory material in that focus to a full white heat,<br>
and can develop phosphorescence. The latter is termed electric<br>
phosphorescence. A great variety of experiments have been devised to<br>
illustrate the phenomena of radiant matter. The vacuum is generally<br>
produced in a hermetically sealed glass vessel into which the electrodes<br>
are sealed, and which contain the phosphorescent substances or other<br>
essentials for the experiments. The vessels are termed Crookes' Tubes.<br>
<br>
[Transcriber's note: Crookes reported on "radiant matter" in 1879. It is<br>
actually electrons, but he failed to distinguish them from ordinary<br>
atoms. Thompson properly described electrons in 1897.]<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Matteueci's Experiment.</span><br>
An experiment for showing the inductive effect of the discharge of a<br>
Leyden jar. Two glass plates are supported on standards in a vertical<br>
position. Flat coils of wire are wound or coiled and secured to one<br>
surface of each plate. One plate has much finer and longer wire than the<br>
other. Metal handles are connected to the ends of the coarser wire coil.<br>
The plates are placed with their coils facing each other. A Leyden jar<br>
is discharged through the coarser coil, while the handles are grasped by<br>
a person. The shock of the discharge is felt by him.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Matting, Electric Floor.</span><br>
Matting or floor covering underlaid with burglar alarm contacts, so<br>
arranged as to be closed by anyone walking on the matting. The contacts<br>
are connected to a burglar alarm system. The object is to provide an<br>
alarm if a burglar enters a house, in case he should enter a door or<br>
window without sounding the bell. The latter can be done by cutting out<br>
the window or part of the door instead of opening it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Maxwell's Theory of Light.</span><br>
A theory of light. It is due to J. Clerk Maxwell.<br>
<br>
It supposes the phenomena of electric induction to be due to the ether,<br>
q. v. It supposes the condition of the ether when conveying light to be<br>
the same as if exposed to the induction of rapidly alternating currents<br>
or discharges (in this case synonymous). It therefore is an<br>
electro-magnetic effect if the theory is correct.<br>
<br>
An electric stress such as one due to the induction of an<br>
electrostatically charged body is not a wave-creating element or factor,<br>
but is a simple stress. But let this stress be stopped and renewed and<br>
at once it appears as a wave-forming agency.<br>
<br>
This stoppage and renewal represents evidently a discharge succeeded by<br>
a charge, or if repeated is equivalent to an intermittent current or an<br>
alternating one.<br>
<br>
<br>
370&nbsp;&nbsp; STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.<br>
<br>
<br>
Again the electrostatic stress kept constant may by being carried<br>
through space carry with it a wave, just as a moving projectile carries<br>
a wave of air in advance of itself.<br>
<br>
Admitting this much the following consequences follow:<br>
<br>
Since in non-conductors the displacement produces a restitution force,<br>
which varies as the displacement which is requisite or is a criterion<br>
for the propagation of waves, while in conductors no such force is<br>
manifested and the electric energy appears as heat, it follows that<br>
light vibrations are not possible in conductors, because<br>
electro-magnetic waves do not exist in them when they are in circuit,<br>
and conductors should be opaque, while the reverse is true for<br>
non-conductors. (Daniell.)<br>
<br>
This is carried out often enough to make a striking evidence in favor of<br>
Maxwell's theory.<br>
<br>
The velocity of propagation of an electro-magnetic disturbance in a<br>
non-conductor should be equal to that of light. This constant is proved<br>
by mathematical considerations, to be approximately the same as the<br>
ratio of the electrostatic to the electromagnetic unit of intensity or<br>
quantity. This ratio is 3E10 (30,000,000,000), which is almost exactly<br>
the velocity of light.<br>
<br>
It also follows from what has been said that if an electrostatically<br>
charged body were whirled around a galvanometer needle at the rate of<br>
3E10 revolutions per second it should affect it like a circulating<br>
current. This rate of rotation cannot be attained, but Rowland has made<br>
manifest the effect of a rotating statically charged body upon a<br>
magnetic needle.<br>
<br>
The above is the merest outline of Maxwell's theory. The full<br>
development must be studied in his own and succeeding works.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Mayer's Floating Magnets.</span><br>
An experiment due to Prof. Mayer. A number of sewing needles are<br>
magnetized and thrust into bits of cork, almost all the way through,<br>
with their like poles projecting. They are floated in a basin of water<br>
and take, under the effects of attraction and repulsion, when approached<br>
by a magnet pole, regular geometric positions, marking out the positions<br>
of angles of polygons.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Measurements.</span><br>
The determination of the value of quantities; determination of the<br>
factor by which the unitary value must be multiplied to produce the<br>
quantity under examination. Such are the measurement of the voltage of a<br>
galvanic battery, or of the ohms of resistance of a conductor.<br>
Electricity has been termed the science of measurement.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Meg or Mega.</span><br>
A prefix, meaning one million times. A megohm is one million ohms; a<br>
megerg is one million ergs; a megadyne is one million dynes.<br>

A cup of iron, wood or some material that does not amalgamate or is<br>
unattacked by mercury, which is filled with mercury and made an<br>
electrode of a circuit. By dipping the other terminal of the circuit<br>
into the mercury a very good contact is obtained. It is well to cover<br>
the mercury with alcohol. The cup may be filled so that the mercury<br>
rises in a meniscus or semi-globule above its edges.<br>
<br>
For some purposes this form is useful, as for contacts with the end of a<br>
swinging wire or pendulum, because in such cases the contact can be made<br>
without the contact point entering the cup. The point swings through the<br>

Fig. 239. SCHALLENBERG'S ALTERNATING CURRENT METER.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Meter, Alternating Current.</span><br>
A meter for measuring alternating current, as supplied to consumers,<br>
from an alternating current system. Like most commercial meters its only<br>
function is the measurement of quantity; the potential difference is<br>
maintained at a constant figure by the generating plant.<br>
<br>
The cut shows the Schallenberg meter. It is simply an alternating<br>
current motor (see Motor, Alternating Current), with air vanes mounted<br>
on its spindle. A main coil passes all the current. Within this is a<br>
second coil complete in itself, and not touching or connecting with the<br>
other. The latter is built up of copper rings. Within the two coils, and<br>
concentric with both is a disc of copper carried by a vertical spindle.<br>
The same spindle carries air vanes, and is free to rotate. As it does so<br>
it moves the indicating machinery.<br>
<br>
The current in the outer coil induces one in the inner coil. Owing to<br>
lag, the current in the inner one differs in phase from that in the<br>
outer one, and a rotatory field is produced. The copper disc acquires<br>
induced polarity, and rotates with speed which normally would be in<br>
proportion to the square of the current. But the object of the meter is<br>
to register the current only. The air vanes effect this. The resistance<br>
of the air to their motion causes the rate of rotation to vary directly<br>
as the speed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Meter Bridge.</span><br>
A form of Wheatstone's bridge in which one lateral pair of arms is<br>
represented by a straight wire. The other pair comprise a known<br>
resistance, and the resistance to be determined. The galvanometer is<br>
connected on one side between the known and unknown resistance. On the<br>
other side its connection is moved back and forth along the straight<br>
wire until the balance is secured and the galvanometer reads zero.<br>
<br>
The relative lengths of wire intercepted between the two ends thereof<br>
and the movable galvanometer connection are proportional to the<br>
resistance of these parts and give the necessary data with the one known<br>
resistance for determining the unknown resistance.<br>
<br>
<br>
374&nbsp;&nbsp; STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.<br>
<br>
<br>
In the original meter bridge the wire was one meter long, whence its<br>
name, and was stretched straight. In more recent examples the wire<br>
varies in length and in one form is bent into a circle or spiral, so as<br>
to make the instrument more compact.<br>
<br>
The contact is not a sliding one, but is adjusted by trial. The contact<br>
piece is slid along, but not touching the wire, and from time to time is<br>
pressed down against the wire. This prevents wear of the wire. The wire<br>
may be made of platinum or of platinum-iridium alloy. The latter is<br>
very hard and not easily worn out.<br>
<br>
Sometimes, as shown in the cut, three parallel wires are stretched along<br>
the baseboard of the instrument, and arranged so that a single wire, two<br>
wires or three wires in series can be used for the proportional sides of<br>
the bridge, thus making it a two-meter or three-meter bridge as desired.<br>
On the other hand some are made of restricted length, as a half or<br>
quarter meter only.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Meter, Chemical Electric.</span><br>
A current meter in which the current is determined by the amount of<br>
chemical decomposition which it can effect. In the Edison meter the<br>
solution is one of zinc sulphate. Two electrodes of zinc are immersed in<br>
it, and a fractional part of the current is passed through it. The gain<br>
in weight of one electrode and the loss in the other are proportional to<br>
the current. Both electrodes are weighed periodically, one acting as<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Meter, Current.</span><br>
An instrument for measuring the quantity of electricity in current form<br>

power supply a fixed potential is usually maintained, the multiple arc<br>

A unit of resistance. (See Resistance, Meter-millimeter.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Meter, Thermal Electric.</span><br>
A current meter in which the current is measured by the heat it imparts<br>
to a conductor. In one meter a very light helix of mica is poised<br>
horizontally over a conductor, and the whole is enclosed in a case. As<br>
the wire is heated it causes an ascending current of air which rotates<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Microphone.</span><br>
An apparatus which includes a contact of variable resistance; such<br>
resistance can be varied in amount by slight vibrations, such as those<br>
produced by sound waves. The apparatus in use forms part of a circuit<br>
including a telephone and current generator. As the contact is varied<br>
the resistance of the circuit and consequently the current intensity<br>
changes and sounds are emitted by the telephone corresponding to such<br>
changes. If the microphone is spoken to, the telephone will emit<br>
corresponding sounds, reproducing the voice.<br>
<br>
It has been found in practice that carbon gives the best microphone<br>
contact. One of the simplest and earliest forms is shown in the cut. A<br>
short rod or pencil of carbon, A, such as used in batteries, is<br>
sharpened at the ends and rests loosely in a vertical position between<br>
two blocks of carbon, C C, in each of which a hole is drilled to receive<br>
one of the points. The blocks are carried on a standard and base D. The<br>
blocks are connected with two terminals x, y, of a circuit, including a<br>
telephone and battery. There are two contacts to be disturbed.<br>
<br>
If delicately adjusted a fly walking over the base-board will disturb<br>
the contacts enough to produce sounds in the telephone. These sounds are<br>
possibly not due only to sound waves, but in part to absolute mechanical<br>
disturbances.<br>
<br>
The various forms of telephone transmitter are generally microphones.<br>

<br>
<br>
A button of compressed lampblack is placed in series with a battery and<br>
galvanometer. A strip of some substance, affected in its length either<br>
by heat or by moisture, is held pressing against the button. A slight<br>
change in length of the strip varies the resistance of the button and<br>
hence affects the galvanometer. In this way exceedingly slight changes<br>
in heat or moisture may be indicated.<br>
<br>
For heat indications vulcanite may be used. The heat of the hand held<br>
near it is enough to affect the galvanometer. For moisture a slip of<br>
gelatine is used. The moisture of a damp slip of paper two or three<br>
inches distant is sufficient to affect the galvanometer.<br>
<br>
In the cut, Fig. 2, shows the general distribution of the apparatus in<br>
circuit with a battery and galvanometer. C is the base of the apparatus,<br>
from which the standard, B, with adjusting screw, H, rises. The strip of<br>
vulcanite is held between I and G. Within D is the carbon button (F in<br>
Fig. 3) pressed between G and E; A is a standard to carry the parts last<br>
described. In Fig. I it is shown as part of a Wheatstone bridge, a, b<br>
and c being resistance coils; l the tasimeter, and g the galvanometer.<br>
If a balance is secured, any variation in the resistance of the<br>

cause them to all impinge upon one of the electrodes, the positive one,<br>
producing luminous effects. The path, if referred to the negative<br>
electrode, tends to be normal to its surface, so that the resultant path<br>
may be curved, as the stream of molecules go to the positive electrode.<br>
The fanciful name of molecular bombardment is given to the phenomenon,<br>
the luminous effect being attributed to the impinging of the molecules<br>
against the positive electrode as they are projected from the positive.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Molecule</span>.<br>
The smallest particle of matter that can exist alone. It is made up of<br>
atoms, but an atom can never exist alone, but only, with one or two<br>
possible exceptions, combined with one or more other atoms as a<br>
molecule. The molecules under present conditions are not in constant<br>
contact with each other, but are perpetually vibrating through paths, in<br>
solids probably in defined paths, in liquids and gases in perpetually<br>
new paths. The molecules collide with each other and rebound. This<br>
motion is the kinetic motion termed heat. At the absolute zero--minus<br>
273.72&deg; C. (-460.7&deg; F.) the molecules would be in contact and
quiescent.<br>
In the gaseous state the molecules of most substances occupy the same<br>
volume; those of a few elements occupy one-half and of others twice the<br>
normal volume. The mean free path of the molecule of hydrogen is about<br>
1/20,000 mm. (1/508,000 inch) (Maxwell) or twice this length (Crookes),<br>
the collisions in hydrogen are about 17,750 millions per second; the<br>
diameter is about 8/10,000,000 mm. (8/254,000,000 inch) ; A particle of<br>
matter 1/4,000 mm. (1/102,000 inch) contains, it is supposed, about<br>
40,000 molecules. The results of different authorities vary so widely as<br>
to deprive the subject of much of its interest. A Sprengel pump, such as<br>
used for exhausting Geissler tubes, or incandescent lamp bulbs, may<br>
leave only one hundred-millionth (1/100,000,000,) of an atmosphere<br>
present, giving the molecules a capability of an average free path of<br>
vibration 33 feet long.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Mordey Effect.</span><br>
A phenomenon observed in dynamo armatures. At full loads the hysteresis<br>
decreases. The effect is thus expressed by S. P. Thompson. "When an<br>
armature core is rotated in a strong magnetic field, the magnetization<br>
of the iron is being continually carried through a cycle, but in a<br>
manner quite different from that in which it is carried when the<br>
magnetizing force is periodically reversed, as in the core of a<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Morse Receiver.</span><br>
The receiving instrument formerly universally used in the Morse system.<br>
It is now but little employed, the sounder having displaced it. Several<br>
types were invented.<br>
<br>
It consists of machinery which carries a reel of paper ribbon arranged<br>
to be fed over a roller by clockwork. A pencil, inking roller, or<br>
embossing stylus (for the latter the roller must have a groove) is<br>
carried by an arm with restricted range of vibration just over the paper<br>
and roller. The armature of an electro-magnet is attached to the arm.<br>
When the magnet is excited the armature is attracted and the marking<br>
device is pressed on the paper. If the clockwork is in operation the<br>
marker will make a line as long as the armature is attracted. When<br>
released no mark will be produced. In this way the dots and dashes of<br>
the Morse code are made on a ribbon of paper.<br>
<br>
As an inking arrangement a small roller is carried by the end of the<br>
vibrating arm. The embosser, or dry point stylus, was very extensively<br>
used. The clockwork was generally driven by descending weights.<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Motor, Electric.</span><br>
A machine or apparatus for converting electric energy into mechanical<br>
kinetic energy. The electric energy is generally of the dynamic or<br>
current type, that is to say, of comparatively low potential and<br>
continuous or virtually continuous flow. Some electrostatic motors have,<br>
however, been made, and an influence machine can often be operated as a<br>
static motor.<br>
<br>
Electric motors of the current type may be divided into two<br>
classes--direct current and alternating current motors.<br>
<br>
Direct current motors are generally based on the same lines of<br>
construction as dynamos. One of the great discoveries in modern<br>
electricity was that if a current is passed through a dynamo, the<br>
armature will rotate. This fact constitutes the principle of the<br>
reversibility of the dynamo.<br>
<br>
<br>
383&nbsp;&nbsp; STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.<br>
<br>
<br>
Motors built on the dynamo model may be series wound, shunt wound, or<br>
compound wound, or of the magneto type, in the latter case having a<br>
fixed field irrespective of any current sent through them. The field may<br>
be produced by an electro-magnet separately excited and unaffected by<br>
the current sent through the motor.<br>
<br>
A current passed through a magneto or motor with separately excited<br>
field will turn it in the direction opposite to that required to produce<br>
the same current from it were it worked as a generator.<br>
<br>
A current passed through a series wound motor acts exactly as above.<br>
<br>
Both these facts follow from Lenz's law, q. v.<br>
<br>
A current passed through a shunt wound motor acts oppositely to the<br>
above. The direction of rotation is the same as that required to produce<br>
a current of the same direction. This is because the field being in<br>
parallel with the armature the motor current goes through the magnet<br>
coils in the direction the reverse of that of the current produced in<br>
the armature when it is used as a dynamo. Hence this also carries out<br>
Lenz's law.<br>
<br>
The compound wound motor acts one way or the other according as its<br>
shunt or series winding preponderates. The two may exactly balance each<br>
other, when there will be no motion at all. The series connections of a<br>
compound wound dynamo should therefore be reversed, making both series<br>
and shunt work in unison, if the dynamo is to be used as a motor.<br>
<br>
The general principles of the electric motor of the dynamo, or<br>
continuous rotation type, can only be outlined here. The current passing<br>
through the field magnets polarizes them and creates a field. Entering<br>
the armature by the brushes and commutators it polarizes its core, but<br>
in such a way that the north pole is away from the south pole of the<br>
field magnet, and the same for the south pole. Hence the armature<br>
rotates. As it does this the brushes connect with other commutator<br>
sections, and the poles of the armature are shifted back. This action<br>
continues indefinitely.<br>
<br>
Another class of motors is of the reciprocating type. These are now very<br>
little used. (See Motor, Reciprocating.)<br>
<br>
One valuable feature of continuous rotation electric motors is the fact<br>
that they absorb energy, to a great extent proportional in amount to the<br>
work they have to do. The rotation of the armature in the field of the<br>
motor involves the cutting of lines of force by its coils. This<br>
generates an electro-motive force contrary in direction to that<br>
producing the actuating current. The more rapid the rotation the greater<br>
is this counter-electro-motive force. The motor armature naturally<br>
revolves faster with diminished resistance to the motion of the<br>
armature. This increases the counter-electromotive force, so that less<br>
energy is absorbed. When the motor is called on to do work, the armature<br>
rotates more slowly, and the counter-electro-motive force diminishes, so<br>
that the machine absorbs more energy. (See Jacobi's Law.)<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Motor Electro-motive Force.</span><br>
The counter-electro-motive force of a motor. (F. J. Sprague.)<br>
<br>
A motor rotates in virtue of the pull of the field magnet upon the poles<br>
of the core of its armature. In responding to this pull the windings of<br>
the armature cuts lines of force and hence generates a<br>
counter-electro-motive force, for which the above term was suggested.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Motor-Generator.</span><br>
A combined motor and generator used to lower the potential difference in<br>
a portion of a circuit, e. g., that part within a building.<br>
<br>
A motor-generator is a dynamo whose armature carries two commutators,<br>
with two separate windings, one of fine wire of many turns, the other of<br>
coarse wire of few turns. If the potential of the system is to be<br>
lowered, the main current is passed through the fine winding. This<br>
causes the armature to turn motor-fashion, and a potential difference is<br>
generated by the rotation of the large coils in the field. This<br>
potential difference is comparatively low and by properly proportioning<br>
the windings may be lowered to as great a degree as required.<br>
<br>
The same apparatus may be inverted so as to raise potential difference.<br>
It acts for continuous current systems as the induction coil transformer<br>
does for alternating current systems.<br>
<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Motor, Multiphase.</span><br>
A motor driven by multiphase currents. It is arranged in general terms<br>
for distribution of the multi phase currents in coils symmetrically<br>
arranged around the circle of the field. These coils are wound on cores<br>
of soft iron. A rotating field is thus produced, and a permanent magnet<br>
or a polarized armature pivoted in such a field will rotate with the<br>
field, its poles following the poles of the rotatory field.<br>
<br>
The cut, Fig. 245, illustrates the principles of action of a four phase<br>
current motor, connected to a four phase current dynamo or generator.<br>
The generator is shown on the left hand of the cut and the motor on the<br>
right hand. In the generator the armature N S is supposed to be turned<br>
by power in the direction shown by the arrow. Each one of the pair of<br>
coils is wound in the reverse sense of the one opposite to it, and the<br>
two are connected in series with each other, and with a corresponding<br>
pair in the motor. The connection can be readily traced by the letters A<br>
A', a a' for one set of coils and B B' b b' for the other set.<br>
<br>
<br>
385&nbsp;&nbsp; STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.<br>
<br>
<br>
For each rotation of the armature two currents, each in opposite<br>
direction, are produced in A A', and the same is the case for B B'.<br>
These currents which have an absolutely constant relation of phase, and<br>
which it will be seen alternate four times for each rotation of the<br>
armature, regulate the polarity of the field of the motor. The resultant<br>
of their action is to keep the poles of the field magnet of the motor<br>
constantly traveling around its circle. Hence the armature N S of the<br>
motor, seen on the right hand of the cut, tends to travel around also<br>
its north and south poles, following the south and north poles of the<br>
rotatory field respectively.<br>

It is not essential that the armature should be a magnet or polarized.<br>
Any mass of soft iron will by induction be polarized and will be<br>
rotated, although not necessarily synchronously, with the rotatory<br>
field. Any mass of copper, such as a disc or cylinder, will have<br>
Foucault currents induced in it and will also rotate. The only<br>
components of such currents which are useful in driving the motor are<br>
those which are at right angles to the lines of force and to the<br>
direction of motion. A very good type of armature based on these<br>
considerations is a core of soft iron wound with insulated copper wire<br>
in one or more closed coils; and so wound as to develop the currents of<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Multiple Arc Box.</span><br>
A resistance box arranged so that the coils may be plugged in multiple<br>
instead of in series. Such can be used as a rheostat, as the resistance<br>
can be very gradually changed by putting the coils one by one into<br>
parallel with each other. Thus by adding in parallel with a 10 ohm coil<br>
a 10,000 ohm coil the resistance is decreased to 9.999001 ohms, and thus<br>
the resistance can be very slowly changed without sudden stops or abrupt<br>
changes.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Multiple Switch Board.</span><br>
A switch board on whose face connecting spring jacks or other devices<br>
are repeated for the same circuits, so that different operators have<br>
each the entire set of connections repeated on the section of the board<br>
immediately in front of and within their reach. This multiplication of<br>
the same set of connections, giving one complete set to each operator,<br>
gives the title "multiple" to the type of switch board in question. The<br>
typical multiple switch board used in telephone exchanges is the best<br>
example of this construction. The calling annunciators of the<br>
subscribers are distributed along the bottom of the board extending its<br>
full length. To each operator a given number is assigned, all within<br>
reach of the right or left hand. This gives five or six feet length of<br>
board to each, and an operator only responds to those subscribers within<br>
his range. But anyone of his subscribers may want to connect with any of<br>
the others in the entire central station. Accordingly in front of each<br>
operator spring jacks are arranged, one for each of the entire set of<br>
subscribers connected in that office. The operator connects as required<br>
any of the calling subscribers, who are comparatively few, to any one of<br>
the large number served by the central station. Thus the entire set of<br>
subscribers' spring jacks are multiplied over and over again so as to<br>
give one set to each operator.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Multiple Wire Method for Working
Electro-magnets.</span><br>
A method for suppressing sparking in working electro-magnets<br>
intermittently. The magnet core is wound with a number (from four to<br>
twenty) of separate layers of fine wire. A separate wire is taken for<br>
each layer and all are wound in the same direction, from one end to the<br>
other of the space or bobbin without returning. The ends are then joined<br>
so as to bring all the wires in parallel. The effect of this is that as<br>
the coils vary in diameter the time constants of each is different from<br>
that of the others, the coefficient of self-induction being less, and<br>
the resistance being greater for the coils farthest from the central<br>
axis. Thus the extra currents run differently in the different coils,<br>
and only a comparatively small spark can be produced owing to the<br>
division of forces thus brought about.<br>

When a resistance is placed in parallel with a galvanometer on a circuit<br>
the following relation obtains. Let s and g equal the resistances of the<br>
shunt and galvanometer respectively, S and G the currents in amperes<br>
passing through them, V the potential difference between their common<br>
terminals, and A the whole current in amperes. Then we have<br>
&nbsp; A = ( (s + g ) / s ) * G<br>
and ( (s + g ) / s ) is termed the multiplying power of the shunt, as it<br>
is the factor by which the current passing through the galvanometer must<br>
be multiplied by to produce the total current.<br>

When a dilute solution of copper acetate is placed on a bright silver<br>
plate and a strip of zinc is touched to the silver beneath the copper, a<br>
series of rings of copper are formed by electrolysis around the zinc.<br>
These are Nobili's rings.<br>
<br>
If for the copper acetate a solution of lead oxide in potassium hydrate<br>
solution is substituted, and if the polished plate which may be German<br>
silver is connected to the positive electrode of a battery, and a<br>
platinum wire connected to the negative pole is immersed in the liquid,<br>
it determines the formation of beautiful iridescent rings of lead<br>
binoxide. The platinum wire is sometimes sealed in glass so that only<br>
its point projects.<br>
<br>
The colors are due to interference of light, the layers of lead oxide<br>
being extremely thin.<br>
<br>
The lead binoxide is formed by secondary reaction. Metallic lead is<br>
first deposited on the negative pole. The oxygen which goes to the<br>
positive pole formed by the polished plate produces lead binoxide which<br>
is deposited there in rings. The reaction is comparable to that of a<br>
storage battery.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Ohmmeter.</span><br>
An instrument for measuring directly the resistance of a conductor or of<br>
any part of a circuit through which a strong current is passing.&nbsp;
It is<br>
the invention of Prof. W. E. Ayrton.<br>
<br>
It contains two fixed coils at right angles to each other acting on the<br>
same needle of soft iron. One coil is of thick wire and is placed in<br>
series with the resistance to be measured. The other is of very thin<br>
wire and is placed in parallel with the same resistance. One wire acts<br>
by the total current, the other by the potential difference between the<br>
ends of the resistance. The action on the soft iron needle is due to the<br>
ratio of potential difference to total currents, or to the resistance<br>
itself. By properly designing and proportioning the coils the angular<br>
deflections of the needle are made proportional to the resistance.<br>
<br>
In use the thick wire may be kept permanently in circuit. On connecting<br>
the binding posts of the thin wire coil to any two parts of the circuit<br>
its resistance is at once given by the deflection of the needle.<br>
<br>
When no current is passing the needle rests in any position. A current<br>
in the thick coil brings it to zero. A current simultaneously passing<br>
through the thin high resistance coil brings about the deflection.<br>
<br>
The instrument is a commercial rather than a scientific one.<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Ohm's Law.</span><br>
The fundamental law expressing the relations between current,<br>
electro-motive force and resistance in an active electric circuit. It<br>
may be expressed thus:<br>
<br>
(a) The current strength is equal to the electro-motive force divided by<br>
the resistance.<br>
<br>
(b) The electro-motive force is equal to the current strength multiplied<br>
by the resistance.<br>
<br>
(c) The resistance is equal to the electro-motive force divided by the<br>
current strength. All these are different forms of the same statement.<br>
Algebraically the law is usually expressed thus, (a) C = E/R. It may<br>
also be expressed thus: (b) E = C*R and (c) R= E/C, in which R denotes<br>
resistance, C denotes current strength, and E denotes electro-motive<br>
force.<br>

Oil insulation has received several applications in electrical work. It<br>
has been proposed for use in underground conduits. These it was proposed<br>
to fill with oil after the insertion of the conductors, the latter<br>
properly wrapped with cotton or other covering. For induction coils it<br>
has been very successfully used. Its principal utility depends on the<br>
fact that it is liquid, so that if pierced by a spark it at once closes<br>
again. A solid insulator if pierced is permanently injured. It is also<br>
used in telegraph insulators (see Insulator, Liquid) to prevent surface<br>
leakage.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Open. adj.</span><br>
An electric circuit is said to be open when it is cut or broken so that<br>
no current can pass through it. The term may be recollected by thinking<br>
of a switch; when open no current can pass through it. The same<br>
adjective is applied to magnetic circuits, an air gap implying an open<br>
circuit.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Open Circuit Oscillation.</span><br>
An oscillation of current in open circuit so that a spark discharge<br>
accompanies it. It is produced by electric resonance in a simple circle<br>
or loop of wire with ends placed near together but not touching, if the<br>
circuit is of such size that its period of oscillation corresponds with<br>
that of the inducing discharge. (See Resonance, Electric.) Its period<br>
depends entirely on the self-induction of the circuit.<br>

and stops, which cause, when operated by the organist, a current to pass<br>
through electro-magnets, opening the valves of the different pipes. Thus<br>
the manual may be at any distance from the organ, and a number of organs<br>
may be worked upon the same manual. As many as five in a single<br>
cathedral are thus connected to a manual in the chancel.<br>

A small light bar magnet suspended by a filament and employed in<br>
determining the intensity of a magnetic field by the oscillations it<br>
completes in a given time after a given disturbance.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Oscillations, Electric.</span><br>
In static electricity the sudden and very rapid alternations in the<br>
discharge of a static condenser. This discharge of the disruptive order<br>
seems a single one, but is really composed of a number of discharges<br>
alternating in direction and producing electro-magnetic ether waves,<br>
probably identical with light waves except that they are longer and far<br>
less rapid.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Oscillatory Electro-motive Force.</span><br>
Electro-motive force rapidly changing in sense or in direction, so that<br>
it presents an oscillatory character. The alternating current and the<br>
telephone current as used in practice are actuated by this type of<br>
electro-motive force.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Osmose, Electric.</span><br>
When two liquids are separated by a porous diaphragm, and a strong<br>
current of electricity is passed through from the liquid on one side,<br>
through the diaphragm, to the liquid on the other side, the liquid on<br>
the side towards which the current is passing rises in level. The<br>
process is termed electric osmose. When a liquid is forced through a<br>
diaphragm a current is produced; in other words electric osmose is<br>
reversible. The current thus produced is termed a diaphragm current.<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Oscillation, Electric.</span><br>
The phase of discharge of a static condenser in one direction. It is<br>
usually followed by a discharge in the opposite direction constituting a<br>
second oscillation, and so on, so that a great number of exceedingly<br>
short oscillations are comprised. Thus, in the discharge of the Leyden<br>
jar a large number of oscillations of current back and forth are<br>
produced, the current alternating like the swings of a pendulum.<br>
<br>
These oscillations are supposed to affect the ether, producing waves in<br>
it identical with light waves, except that we have not been able yet to<br>
produce them short enough to affect the visual organs. The waves thus<br>
produced can be reflected or refracted; some substances are transparent<br>
for them and others opaque. There is a possibility that man may yet<br>
succeed in producing electric oscillations of sufficient frequency to<br>
bring about the direct production of light.<br>

As a unit of output of a dynamo Prof. Sylvanus P. Thompson has proposed<br>
1,000 watts, or one kilowatt. This unit is now frequently used. To<br>
completely define the dynamo, however, the amperage or the voltage must<br>
also be given, as a 10 kilowatt--110 volt machine, or a 10 kilowatt--99<br>
ampere machine.<br>
<br>
[Transcriber's note: 10 kilowatt at 110 volts is 91 amperes.]<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Over-Compounding.</span><br>
A proportioning of the series and shunt windings of a compound dynamo,<br>
so that the voltage of the terminals rises with the load or output<br>
enough to allow for the drop in mains, thus maintaining the potential<br>
for full load at distant points in a district. It is carried out by an<br>
increase of ampere-turns in the series winding.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Overload.</span><br>
In an electric motor a mechanical load put upon it so great as to<br>
prevent economical working. One effect of such a load is to make the<br>
armature run so slowly as to unduly reduce the counter-electro-motive<br>
force and hence to permit so much current to pass through the coils as<br>
to heat them, perhaps injuriously. In this case the production of heat<br>
implies the waste of energy.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Overtype Dynamo or Motor.</span><br>
A dynamo or motor whose armature is placed above or in the upper part of<br>
the field magnets, the yoke piece of the magnets being in or resting<br>

<br>
It is produced by electric discharges and it is its peculiar odor which<br>
is noticed about an electric machine, and sometimes in a thunderstorm<br>
near the path of a lightning flash.<br>
<br>
In the electrolysis of water some ozone may be produced, thus<br>
diminishing the volume of the oxygen or of the mixed gases given off.<br>
This is a source of inaccuracy in a gas voltameter.<br>

To coat or saturate with paraffine wax. Paper may be paraffined by<br>
dipping in the wax, or by being sprinkled with fragments of wax,<br>
subsequently melted in with a hot iron or otherwise. The tops of battery<br>
carbons are often paraffined to prevent the acid from rising in the<br>
pores by capillary attraction and rusting the connections.<br>

A hydro-carbon composed principally of mixtures of the higher members of<br>
the paraffine series C n H2 n + 2. It is made from cannel coal, coal<br>
tar, or petroleum by distillation. It is an insulator. Its resistance at<br>
46&deg; C. (114.8&deg; F.) per centimeter cube is 3.4E16 ohms, or about
the<br>
highest resistance known.<br>
<br>
Its specific inductive capacity (for milky wax) is 2.47 (Schiller). For<br>
clear wax it is given as follows by different authorities:<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Parallax.</span><br>
The apparent change in position of an object when looked at from two<br>
points of view. By looking at an object a few feet distant first with<br>
one eye and then with the other, the shifting in apparent position is<br>
seen.<br>
<br>
In reading the position of an indicator or needle over a scale parallax<br>
introduces an error unless the eye is held vertically over the needle.<br>
By making the dial of looking- glass and holding the eye so that the<br>
reflection of its pupil is bisected by the needle this verticality is<br>
ensured.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Parallel.</span><br>
(a) In the nomenclature of electric circuits two or more conductors<br>
leading from one point to another, are said to be in parallel.<br>
<br>
(b) When two or more conductors connect two main leads of comparatively<br>
large size and low resistance they are said to be in parallel or in<br>
multiple arc. This order is easiest pictured as the rungs of a ladder in<br>
parallel connecting its two sides representing the main leads.<br>
<br>
It may be used as a noun as "arranged in parallel," or as an adjective<br>
as "a parallel circuit," the opposite of series, q. v.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Paramagnetic. adj.</span><br>
Possessing paramagnetic properties; tending to occupy a position with<br>
the longer axis parallel to the lines of force of a magnetic field;<br>
having magnetism; attracted by a magnet.<br>
<br>
"If a homogeneous isotropic substance is placed in a magnetic field it<br>
becomes magnetized at every point in the direction of the magnetic<br>
intensity at that point, and with an intensity of magnetization<br>
proportional to the magnetic intensity. When the positive direction of<br>
the induced magnetization is the same as that of the magnetic intensity<br>
the substance is called Magnetic or Paramagnetic; when it is opposite,<br>
the substance is called Diamagnetic." (Emtage.)<br>
<br>
A paramagnetic substance has high permeability or multiplying power for<br>
lines of force, hence in a magnetic field a bar of iron, etc., is in<br>
unstable equilibrium unless its longer axis is parallel with the lines<br>
of force in order to reduce as much as possible the reluctance of the<br>
circuit.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
Iron is the most paramagnetic of all substances. Other paramagnetic<br>
metals are: Nickel, cobalt, manganese, platinum, cerium, osmium,<br>
palladium. Diamagnetic metals are bismuth, antimony, zinc, tin, mercury,<br>
lead, silver, copper, gold, arsenic. Bismuth is the most diamagnetic of<br>
all metals.<br>
<br>
Of gases oxygen is most paramagnetic. Becquerel calculated that a cubic<br>
yard of oxygen condensed would act on a magnetic needle as powerfully as<br>
5.5 grains of metallic iron. Liquefied oxygen will adhere to the poles<br>
of a magnet.<br>
<br>
Changes of temperature and of other conditions may affect a body's<br>
magnetism. Thus hot oxygen is diamagnetic, and a substance paramagnetic<br>
in a vacuum may be diamagnetic in air.<br>
<br>
Of liquids, solutions of iron or cobalt are paramagnetic; water, blood,<br>
milk, alcohol, ether, oil of turpentine and most saline solutions are<br>
diamagnetic.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Paramagnetism.</span><br>
(a) The science or study of paramagnetic substances and phenomena.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Passive State.</span><br>
A state of a substance in virtue of which it is unattacked by a solvent<br>
which ordinarily would dissolve or attack it. Iron in strong nitric acid<br>
is unattacked or assumes the passive state. This particular case is<br>
supposed to be due to a coating of magnetic oxide, so that there would<br>
be properly speaking no question of a passive state, but only one of<br>
superficial protection.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Peltier Effect.</span><br>
The thermal effect produced by the passage of a current through the<br>
junction of two unlike conductors. Such junction is generally the seat<br>
of thermo-electric effects, and a current is generally produced by<br>
heating such a junction. If an independent current is passed in the same<br>
direction as that of the thermoelectric current, it cools the junction,<br>
and warms it if passed in the other direction. In general terms,<br>
referring to thermo-electric couples, if passed through them it tends to<br>
cool the hot and heat the cool junction. The phenomenon does not occur<br>
in zinc-copper junctions.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Peltier's Cross.</span><br>
A bar of bismuth and a bar of antimony soldered centre to centre at<br>
right angles, being notched or halved there to receive or to set into<br>
each other. It is used to demonstrate the Peltier effect, q. v. To one<br>
pair of ends are connected the terminals of a battery circuit; to the<br>
other pair are connected the terminals of a galvanometer.<br>
<br>
The galvanometer by its deflections in one and then in the other<br>
direction indicates that the junction is heated when the current passes<br>
from antimony to bismuth and vice versa. It thus illustrates the heating<br>
and cooling of a thermo-electric junction by a current of electricity.<br>
The current from the battery by the Peltier effect either heats or cools<br>
the junction, as the case may be. This heating or cooling them produces<br>
a thermo-electric current in the galvanometer circuit. The battery has<br>
no direct influence on the galvanometer.<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Pendant Cord.</span><br>
A double conductor or pair of conductors, insulated from each other and<br>
covered with a worsted, silk, or cotton covering and used to suspend<br>
incandescent lamps and at the same time to conduct the current to them.<br>
It is also used for other similar service, such as acting as conductors<br>
for small motors. Often each conductor is composed of a number of thin<br>
wires laid together. This gives flexibility to the cord.<br>

the lower end of the pendulum swinging through a globule of mercury may<br>
close and open the circuit. Various other methods of accomplishing the<br>
same end are employed ..<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Pen, Electric.</span><br>
A stylus for producing a series of perforations in paper, so that the<br>
paper may act as a stencil for the reproduction of a great number of<br>
copies of the original matter. Various kinds of electric pens have been<br>
invented. One kind, invented by Edison, consists of a handle carrying an<br>
electric motor actuating a needle, which is driven in and out of the<br>
other end of the handle with high rapidity. It is used by being held<br>
vertically on the paper with the needle end downward, and is moved so as<br>
to describe perforated letters or designs. The paper is then used as a<br>
stencil with an ink roller to reproduce the writing or design ad<br>
libitum. A simpler kind dispenses with the motor and depends on the<br>
perforations produced by the electric spark. As shown in the cut the<br>
stylus is one terminal of an induction coil circuit. The support on<br>
which the paper rests is the other terminal and must be a conductor. In<br>
use the induction coil is started, and the stylus is moved over the<br>
paper; a series of sparks pass through the paper from stylus to the<br>
supporting tablet, perforating the paper and producing a stencil to be<br>
used for reproduction.<br>

A standard of illuminating power; in it the combustible substance is a<br>
gas made by mixing one cubic foot of air with three cubic inches of<br>
liquid pentane, measured at 60&deg; F. or, if measured as gases, 20
volumes<br>
of air to 7 of pentane. It is burned at the rate of 0.5 cubic foot per<br>
hour from a cylindrical tube one inch in diameter, closed at the top by<br>
a disc 0.5 inch thick with a hole 0.25 inch in diameter, through which<br>
the gas issues. It gives a flame 2.5 inches high.<br>
<br>
The pentane used is the distillate of petroleum which boils at 50&deg;
C.<br>
(122&deg; F.) ; it has a specific gravity at 15&deg; C. (60&deg; F.) of
from 0.628<br>
to 0.631. It is almost pure pentane (C5H12).<br>
<br>
As long as the rate of consumption is between 0.48 and 0.52 cubic foot<br>
per hour the flame gives practically the same light.<br>

An apparatus used in automatic high speed telegraphy for perforating<br>
strips of paper. These are then used by drawing between a roller and<br>
contact spring for making and breaking the telegraphic circuit for the<br>
production of a record, such as the Morse record, at the distant<br>
receiving station.<br>
<br>
The perforated strip has different classes of holes punched in it to<br>
represent dots or dashes. It is fed by machinery very rapidly, so that<br>
the message is transmitted with the highest speed. Several operators may<br>
simultaneously prepare the paper strips, and thus in conjunction with<br>
its rapid feeding in the transmitter, far surpass the time of ordinary<br>
direct transmission.<br>

In electric current conductors the property of possessing conductivity<br>
unaffected by lapse of time. Generally the permanency of conductors is<br>
very high. In some cases a slow annealing takes place which causes a<br>
gradual change with the lapse of time. Annealed German silver wire has<br>
been found to increase in conductivity at about .02 per cent. in a year.<br>
(Matthiessen.) Wire, whether annealed or not, is left in a strained<br>
condition after the drawing operations, and such a change is consonant<br>
with this fact. The figure only applies to the samples tested by<br>
Matthiessen.<br>

slot. A hole is drilled through one end, and a rod of the iron to be<br>
tested is passed through this hole and through the coil to the bottom of<br>
the slot. The lower end of the rod must be accurately faced off. The<br>
current is turned on, upon which the rod adheres to the bottom of the<br>
slot. The force required to detach it is determined with a spring<br>
balance. The permeation through its face is proportional to the square<br>
of the force required.<br>

It consists of a cylinder of wax-like material which is rotated and<br>
moved slowly, longitudinally, screw fashion, at an even speed. A glass<br>
diaphragm carrying a needle point is supported with the point barely<br>
touching the wax. If the diaphragm is agitated, as by being spoken<br>
against, the needle is driven back and forwards cutting a broken line or<br>
groove following the direction of the thread of a screw in the wax, the<br>
depth of which line or groove continually varies.<br>
<br>
This imprints the message. If the needle is set back and the cylinder is<br>
rotated so as to carry the needle point over the line thus impressed,<br>
the varying depth throws the needle and diaphragm into motion and the<br>
sound is reproduced.<br>

An apparatus for measuring the intensity of light emitted by a given<br>
lamp or other source of illuminating power. They may be classified into<br>
several types.<br>
<br>
Calorimetric or Heat Photometers act by measuring relatively the heat<br>
produced by the ether waves (so-called radiant heat) emitted by the<br>
source. The accuracy of the instrument is increased by passing the rays<br>
through an alum solution. A thermopile, or an air thermometer, may be<br>
used to receive the rays.<br>
<br>
Chemical Photometers. In these the light falls upon sensitized<br>
photographic paper. The depth of coloration is used as the index of<br>
illuminating power.<br>
<br>
Direct Visual Photometers. These include Rumford's Shadow Photometer,<br>
Bunsen's Bar Photometer, and Wheatstone's Bead Photometer, in which the<br>
light is estimated by direct visual comparison of its effects.<br>
<br>
Optical Photometers. These include Polarization Photometers, in which<br>
the light is polarized; Dispersion Photometers, in which a diverging<br>
lens is placed in the path of the rays of light so as to reduce the<br>
illuminating power in more rapid ratio than that of the square of the<br>
distance.<br>
<br>
Selenium Photometers, in which the variations in resistance of selenium<br>
as light of varying intensity falls upon it is used as the indicator of<br>
the intensity of the light.<br>
<br>
Jet Photometers, for gas only, in which the height of a flame under<br>
given conditions, or the conditions requisite to maintain a flame of<br>
given height, is used to indicate the illuminating power.<br>
<br>
The subject of photometers has acquired more importance than ever in<br>
view of the extensive introduction of the electric light. (See Candle,<br>
Standard--Carcel--Viol&eacute;'s Standard--and Photometers of various
kinds.)<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Photometer, Actinic.</span><br>
A photometer whose registrations are produced by the action of the light<br>
being tested upon sensitized paper or plates, such as used in<br>
photography. Some efforts at self-registering photometers have been<br>
based on actinic registration of the height of a flame of the gas to be<br>
tested.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Photometer, Bar.</span><br>
A photometer in which the two lights to be compared are fixed at or<br>
opposite to the ends of a bar or scale of known length, generally 60 or<br>
100 inches. The bar is divided by the rule of the inverse square of the<br>
distances, so that if a screen is placed on any part of the bar where it<br>
receives an equal amount of light from both sources, the figure on the<br>
bar will indicate the relative illuminating power of the larger lamp or<br>
light in terms of the smaller. The divisions of the bar are laid out on<br>
the principle that the illuminating power of the two sources of light<br>
will vary inversely with the square of their distance from the screen.<br>
<br>
<br>
412&nbsp;&nbsp; STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.<br>
<br>
<br>
The screen used is sometimes the Bunsen disc. This is a disc of paper<br>
with a spot of paraffine wax in the centre melted thoroughly into the<br>
paper or with a ring of paraffine wax surrounding the untouched centre.<br>
When this disc is equally illuminated on both sides the spot is nearly<br>
invisible. Inequality of illumination brings it out more visibly.<br>
Sometimes a Leeson disc is used. This consists of three pieces of paper,<br>
two thin ones between which a thicker piece, out of which a star is cut,<br>
is laid. When equally illuminated on both sides the star appears equally<br>
bright on both sides.<br>
<br>
The bar photometer is the standard form. A candle or pair of candles may<br>
be burned at one end and an incandescent lamp at the other, or a gas<br>
flame may first be rated by candles and used as a standard.<br>

A photometer in which the radiant energy, so called radiant heat, is<br>
used as the measurer of the light.<br>
<br>
In one type a differential air thermometer is used, one of whose bulbs<br>
is blackened. On exposing this bulb to a source of light it will become<br>
heated, and if lights of the same character are used the heating will be<br>
in proportion to their illuminating power quite closely. The heating is<br>
shown by the movements of the index. By careful calibration the<br>
instrument may be made quite reliable.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Photometer, Dispersion.</span><br>
A photometer in which the rays from one of the lights under comparison<br>
are made more divergent by a concave lens. In this way a strong light,<br>
such as all arc lamp can be photometered more readily than where only<br>
the natural divergence of the beam exists. The law of the variation of<br>
the intensity of light with the square of the distance is abrogated for<br>
a law of more rapid variation by the use of a concave lens.<br>
<br>
The diagram, Fig. 260, illustrates the principle. E represents a<br>
powerful light, an arc light, to be tested. Its distance from the screen<br>
is e. Its light goes through the concave lens L and is dispersed as<br>
shown over an area A1, instead of the much smaller area A, which the<br>
same rays would otherwise cover. Calling l the distance of the lens from<br>
the screen, f its focus, and c the distance of the standard candle from<br>
the screen when the shadows are of equal intensity, we have the<br>
proportion.<br>

A rod is supported in a vertical position. Back of it is a screen of<br>
white paper. The two lights to be compared are arranged in front of the<br>
rod and at a little distance from each other. They are shifted about<br>
until the two shadows appear of equal darkness. The relative intensity<br>
of the lights varies inversely with the square of their distances from<br>
the shadows cast respectively by them on the screen.<br>

immersed overbalances the article. When the plating is being deposited<br>
as soon as it exceeds the excess of weight of the counterpoise the<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Plating Bath.</span><br>
A vessel of solution for the deposition of metal by electrolysis as used<br>
in electro-plating.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Plating, Electro-.</span><br>
The deposition of metal by electrolysis so as to coat the conducting<br>
surface of objects therewith. The full details of the many processes are<br>
very lengthy and cannot be given here.<br>
<br>
The general principle includes a battery or source of electric current.<br>
The object to be plated is connected to the negative terminal and is<br>
immersed in the solution. Thus with a battery the object is in<br>
electrical connection with the zinc plate. To the other terminal a<br>
metallic plate is connected. The object and the plate termed the anode<br>
being introduced into a suitable bath, the metal whose solution is in<br>
the bath is deposited upon the surface of the object.<br>
<br>
The bath is a solution of the metal in some form that will lend itself<br>
to the electrolytic action. The anode is often a plate of the metal of<br>
the bath, so that it dissolves as fast as metal is deposited on the<br>
object, thus keeping up the strength of the solution.<br>
<br>
The objects to be plated must be scrupulously clean, and great care must<br>
be taken to keep the bath uncontaminated.<br>
<br>
When the object has a non-conducting surface, it is made conducting by<br>
being brushed over with plumbago q.v. In addition iron dust is sometimes<br>
dusted over it. This acts by precipitating the metal of the bath<br>
directly and thus giving a conducting basis for the metal to deposit on.<br>
To avoid getting iron in a bath the object may be dipped in copper<br>
sulphate solution. This precipitates copper in place of the iron and<br>
leaves the article in good shape for silver or other plating.<br>
<br>
Electro-plating, if made thick enough, gives a reverse of the article<br>
when separated therefrom. A direct copy can be got by a second plating,<br>
on the first plating after separation, or a wax impression can be<br>
employed.<br>
<br>
Under the different metals, formulae for the baths will be found. (See<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Point, Null.</span><br>
A nodal point in electrical resonators; a point where in a system of<br>
waves or oscillations, there is rest, the zero of motion being the<br>
resultant of oppositely directed and equal forces. In electrical<br>
resonators it is to be sought for in a point symmetrically situated,<br>
with reference to the spark gap, or in a pair of points, which pair is<br>
symmetrically placed.<br>
<br>
The null point in resonators is found by connecting a lead from one of<br>
the secondary terminals of an induction coil to different parts of the<br>
resonator. The null point is one where the connection does not give rise<br>
to any sparks between the micrometer knobs or spark gap, or where the<br>
sparks are of diminished size.<br>
<br>
The whole is exactly comparable to loops and nodes in a vibrating string<br>
or in a Chladni plate as described in treatises on sound and acoustics.<br>

Magnet poles that are virtually points, or of no magnitude. A long thin<br>

In a magnet with consequent poles, the points where such poles are<br>
situated.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Points, Corresponding.</span><br>
In bound electrostatic charges the points of equal charges of opposite<br>
potentials; the points at opposite extremities of electrostatic lines of<br>
force. This definition implies that the bound charges shall be on equal<br>
facing areas of conductors, as otherwise the spread or concentration of<br>
the lines of force would necessitate the use of areas of size<br>
proportionate to the spreading or concentrating of the lines of force.<br>
At the same time it may figuratively be applied to these cases, the<br>
penetration of the surface by a single line of force including the area<br>
fixed by its relation to the surrounding lines.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Polarity, Diamagnetic.</span><br>
The induced polarity of diamagnetic substances; it is the reverse of<br>
paramagnetic polarity, or of the polarity of iron. A bar of diamagnetic<br>
material held parallel with the lines of force in a magnetic field has a<br>
like pole induced in the end nearest a given pole of the field magnet,<br>
and vice versa. This theory accounts for the repulsion by a magnet of a<br>
diamagnetic substance. The existence of this polarity is rather an<br>
assumption. It originated with Faraday.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Polarity, Paramagnetic.</span><br>
The induced polarity of paramagnetic substances, such as iron, nickel,<br>
or cobalt.<br>
<br>
When such a substance is brought into a magnetic field the part nearest<br>
a specific pole of a magnet acquires polarity opposite to that of such<br>
pole and is thereby attracted.<br>
<br>
Another way of expressing it, in which the existence of a pole in or<br>
near to the field is not implied, is founded on the conventional<br>
direction of lines of force. Where these enter the substance a south<br>
pole is formed and where they emerge a north pole is formed.<br>
<br>
Such polarity tends always to be established in the direction of<br>
greatest length, if the body is free to rotate.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Polarization.</span><br>
(a) The depriving of a voltaic cell of its proper electro-motive force.<br>
Polarization may be due to various causes. The solution may become<br>
exhausted, as in a Smee battery, when the acid is saturated with zinc<br>
and thus a species of polarization follows. But the best definition of<br>
polarization restricts it to the development of counter-electro-motive<br>
force in the battery by the accumulation of hydrogen on the negative<br>
(carbon or copper) plate. To overcome this difficulty many methods are<br>
employed. Oxidizing solutions or solids are used, such as solution of<br>
chromic acid or powdered manganese dioxide, as in the Bunsen and<br>
Leclanch&eacute; batteries respectively; a roughened surface of
platinum black<br>
is used, as in the Smee battery; air is blown through the solution to<br>
carry off the hydrogen, or the plates themselves are moved about in the<br>
solution.<br>
<br>
(b) Imparting magnetization to a bar of iron or steel, thus making a<br>
permanent magnet, is the polarization of the steel of which it is made.<br>
Polarization may be permanent, as in steel, or only temporary, as in<br>
soft iron.<br>
<br>
(c) The strain upon a dielectric when it separates two oppositely<br>
charged surfaces. The secondary discharge of a Leyden jar, and its<br>
alteration in volume testify to the strain put upon it by charging.<br>
<br>
(d) The alteration of arrangement of the molecules of an electrolyte by<br>
a decomposing current. All the molecules are supposed to be arranged<br>
with like ends pointing in the same direction, positive ends facing the<br>
positively-charged plate and negative ends the negatively-charged one.<br>
<br>
(e) The production of counter-electro-motive force in a secondary<br>
battery, or in any combination capable of acting as the seat of such<br>
counter-electro-motive force. (See Battery, Secondary--Battery, Gas.)<br>
The same can be found often in organized cellular tissue such as that of<br>
muscles, nerves, or of plants. If a current is passed through this in<br>
one direction, it often establishes a polarization or potential<br>
difference that is susceptible of giving a return current in the<br>
opposite direction when the charging battery is replaced by a conductor.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Polarization Capacity.</span><br>
A voltaic cell in use becomes polarized by its negative plate<br>
accumulating hydrogen, or other cause. This gradually gives the plate a<br>
positive value, or goes to set up a counter-electro-motive force. The<br>
quantity of electricity required to produce the polarization of a<br>
battery is termed its Polarization Capacity or Capacity of Polarization.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Polarization of the Medium.</span><br>
The dielectric polarization, q. v., of a dielectric, implying the<br>
arrangement of its molecules in chains or filaments; a term due to<br>
Faraday. He illustrated it by placing filaments of silk in spirits of<br>
turpentine, and introduced into the liquid two conductors. On<br>
electrifying one and grounding (or connecting to earth) the other one,<br>
the silk filaments arranged themselves in a chain or string connecting<br>
the points of the conductors.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Polar Region.</span><br>
That part of the surface of a magnet whence the internal magnetic lines<br>
emerge into the air. (S. P. Thompson.) As such lines may emerge from<br>
virtually all parts of its surface, the polar regions are indefinite<br>
areas, and are properly restricted to the parts whence the lines emerge<br>
in greatest quantity.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Polar Span.</span><br>
A proportion of the circle which represents the transverse section of<br>
the armature space between the pole pieces of the field magnet in a<br>
dynamo or motor; it is the proportion which is filled by the faces of<br>
the pole pieces.<br>

being quite large compared to the core proper of the magnet.<br>
<br>
They are calculated so as to produce a proper distribution of and<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Portelectric Railroad.</span><br>
A railroad worked by solenoidal attraction, the car forming the core of<br>
the solenoids. It includes a series of solenoids or hollow coils of<br>
copper wire distributed all along the road and inclosing within<br>
themselves the track. On this a cylindrical car with pointed ends moves<br>
on wheels. Current is supplied to the solenoid in advance of the car,<br>
and attracts it. As it advances it breaks the contacts of the attracting<br>
solenoid and turns the current into the one next in advance. This<br>
operation is repeated as the car advances.<br>
<br>
The solenoids are placed close together, each including in the trial<br>
track 630 turns of No. 14 copper wire. The car was of wrought iron, 12<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Position Finder.</span><br>
An instrument for determining the position of objects which are to be<br>
fired at from forts. It is designed for use from forts situated on the<br>
water.<br>
<br>
Fiske's position finder may be thus generally described. On a chart the<br>
channel is divided into squares, and the position finder determines the<br>
square in which a vessel lies. For each square the direction and<br>
elevation of the guns is calculated beforehand. The enemy can therefore<br>
be continuously located and fired at, although from smoke or other cause<br>
the object may be quite invisible to the gunner.<br>
<br>
It comprises two telescopes situated at distant extremities of as long a<br>
base line as is obtainable. These telescopes are kept directed upon the<br>
object by two observers simultaneously. The observers are in constant<br>
telephonic communication. As each telescope moves, it carries a contact<br>
over an arc of conducting material. Below each telescope is an arm also<br>
moving over an arc of conducting material. These arcs enter into a<br>
Wheatstone bridge and are so connected that when the arm and the distant<br>
telescope are at the same angle or parallel a balance is obtained. Thus<br>
each observer has the power of establishing a balance. A chart is<br>
provided for each of them, and over it the arm connected with the<br>
distant telescope and an arm or indicator attached to the telescope at<br>
that station move so that as long as both telescopes point at the object<br>
and each observer maintains the electric balance, the intersection of<br>
the arms shows the position on the chart.<br>
<br>
The Position Finder is a simplification and amplification of the Range<br>
Finder, q. v. In practice the observers may be placed far from the<br>
forts, and may telephone their observations thereto. It has been found<br>
accurate within one-third of one per cent.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Potential.</span><br>
Potential in general may be treated as an attribute of a point in space,<br>
and may express the potential energy which a unit mass would have if<br>
placed at that point.<br>
<br>
This conception of potential is that of a property attributable to a<br>
point in space, such that if a unit mass were placed there the forces<br>
acting upon it would supply the force factor of energy, while the body<br>
would supply the mass factor. This property is expressible in units,<br>
which produce, if the supposed mass is a unit mass, units of work or<br>
energy, but potential itself is neither.<br>
<br>
Thus taking gravitation, a pound mass on the surface of the earth<br>
(assuming it to be a sphere of 4,000 miles radius) would require the<br>
expenditure of 21,120,000 foot pounds to remove it to an infinite<br>
distance against gravity. The potential of a point in space upon the<br>
surface of the earth is therefore negative and is represented by<br>
-21,120,000*32.2 foot poundals (32.2 = acceleration of gravity). (See<br>
Poundal.) In practice and conventionally all points on the earth's<br>
surface are taken as of zero potential.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Potential, Absolute.</span><br>
The absolute electrical potential at a point possesses a numerical value<br>
and measures the tendency which the existing electric forces would have<br>
to drive an electrified particle away from or prevent its approach to<br>
the point, if such a particle, one unit in quantity, were brought up to<br>
or were situated at that point. It is numerically equal to the number of<br>
ergs of work which must be done to bring a positive unit of electricity<br>
from a region where there is absolutely no electric force up to the<br>
point in question. (Daniell.) Two suppositions are included in this. The<br>
region where there is an electric force has to be and only can be at an<br>
infinite distance from all electrified bodies. The moving of the<br>
particle must take place without any effect upon the distribution of<br>
electricity on other particles.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Potential, Constant.</span><br>
Unchanging potential or potential difference.<br>
<br>
The ordinary system of incandescent lighting is a constant potential<br>
system, an unvarying potential difference being maintained between the<br>
two leads, and the current varying according to requirements.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Potential Difference, Electric.</span><br>
If of any two points the absolute potentials are determined, the<br>
difference between such two expresses the potential difference.<br>
Numerically it expresses the quantity of work which must be done to<br>
remove a unit of electricity from one to the other against electric<br>
repulsion, or the energy which would be accumulated in moving it the<br>
other way.<br>
<br>
A positively charged particle is driven towards the point of lower<br>
potential. A negatively charged body is driven in the reverse direction.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Potential Difference, Electro-motive.</span><br>
A difference of potential in a circuit, or in part of a circuit, which<br>
difference produces or is capable of producing a current, or is due to<br>
the flow of such current.<br>
<br>
It may be expressed as the fall in potential or the electro-motive force<br>
included between any two points on a circuit. The current in an active<br>
circuit is due to the total electro-motive force in the circuit. This is<br>
distributed through the circuit in proportion to the resistance of its<br>
parts. Owing to the distribution of electro-motive force throughout a<br>
circuit including the generator, the terminals of a generator on closed<br>
circuit may show a difference of potential far lower than the<br>
electro-motive force of the generator on closed circuit. Hence potential<br>
difference in such a case has been termed available electro-motive<br>
force.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Potential, Electric Absolute.</span><br>
The mathematical expression of a property of a point in space, measuring<br>
the tendency which existing electric forces would have to drive an<br>
electrified unit particle away from or prevent its approach to the point<br>
in question, according to whether the point was situated at or was at a<br>
distance from the point in question.<br>
<br>
Potential is not the power of doing work, although, as it is expressed<br>
always with reference to a unit body, it is numerically equal to the<br>
number of ergs of work which must be done in order to bring a positive<br>
unit of electricity from a region where there is no electric<br>
force--which is a region at an infinite distance from all electrified<br>
bodies--up to the point in question. This includes the assumption that<br>
there is no alteration in the general distribution of electricity on<br>
neighboring bodies. (Daniell.)<br>

In practice the earth is arbitrarily taken as of zero electric
potential.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Potential, Fall of.</span><br>
The change in potential between any two points on an active circuit. The<br>
change in potential due to the maintenance of a current through a<br>
conductor.<br>
<br>
The fall in potential multiplied by the current gives work or energy<br>
units.<br>
<br>
The fall of potential in a circuit and its subsequent raising by the<br>
action of the generator is illustrated by the diagram of a helix. In it<br>
the potential fall in the outer circuit is shown by the descent of the<br>
helix. This represents at once the outer circuit and the fall of<br>
potential in it. The vertical axis represents the portion of the circuit<br>
within the battery or generator in which the potential by the action of<br>
the generator is again raised to its original height.<br>
<br>
In a circuit of even resistance the potential falls evenly throughout<br>
it.<br>
<br>
A mechanical illustration of the relation of fall of potential to<br>
current is shown in the cut Fig. 269. A vertical wire is supposed to be<br>
fixed at its upper end and a lever arm and cord at its lower end, with<br>
weight and pulley imparts a torsional strain to it. The dials and<br>
indexes show a uniform twisting corresponding to fall of potential. For<br>
each unit of length there is a definite loss of twisting, corresponding<br>
to fall of potential in a unit of length of a conductor of uniform<br>
resistance. The total twisting represents the total potential<br>
difference. The weight sustained by the twisting represents the current<br>
maintained by the potential difference. For a shorter wire less twisting<br>
would be needed to sustain the weight, as in a shorter piece of the<br>
conductor less potential difference would be needed to maintain the same<br>
current.<br>

The magnetic potential at any point of a magnetic field expresses the<br>
work which would be done by the magnetic forces of the field on a<br>
positive unit of magnetism as it moves from that point to an infinite<br>
distance therefrom. The converse applies to a negative unit.<br>
<br>
It is the exact analogue of absolute electric potential.<br>
<br>
The potential at any point due to a positive pole m at a distance r is<br>
m/r;. that due to a negative pole - m at a distance r' is equal to<br>
-m/r';. that due to both is equal to m/r - m/r' or m(1/r - 1/r').<br>
<br>
Like electric potential and potential in general, magnetic potential<br>
while numerically expressing work or energy is neither, although often<br>
defined as such.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Potential, Unit of Electric.</span><br>
The arbitrary or conventional potential--or briefly, the potential of a<br>

of work necessary to bring a unit of electricity up to the point in<br>
question from a region of nominal zero potential--i. e., from the<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Potentiometer.</span><br>
An arrangement somewhat similar to the Wheatstone Bridge for determining<br>
potential difference, or the electro-motive force of a battery. In<br>
general principle connection is made so that the cell under trial would<br>
send a current in one direction through the galvanometer. Another<br>
battery is connected, and in shunt with its circuit the battery under<br>
trial and its galvanometer are connected, but so that its current is in<br>
opposition. By a graduated wire, like that of a meter bridge, the<br>
potential of the main battery shunt can be varied until no current<br>
passes. This gives the outline of the method only.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Poundal.</span><br>
The British unit of force; the force which acting on a mass of one pound<br>

produces an acceleration of ONE FOOT PER SECOND PER SECOND.]<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Power. Activity;</span><br>
the rate of activity, of doing work, or of expending energy. The<br>
practical unit of electric power is the volt-ampere or watt, equal to<br>
1E7 ergs per second. The kilowatt, one thousand watts or volt-amperes,<br>
is a frequently adopted unit.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Power, Electric.</span><br>
As energy is the capacity for doing work, electric energy is
represented <br>
by electricity in motion against a resistance. This possesses a species
<br>
of inertia, which gives it a species of kinetic energy. To produce such
<br>
motion, electro- motive force is required. The product of E. M. F. by <br>
quantity is therefore electric energy. (See Energy, Electric.)<br>
<br>
Generally the rate of energy or power is used. Its dimensions are<br>
&nbsp;( ( (M^.5)*(L^.5) ) / T )&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; ( ( (M^.5) *(L^1.5)
)/( T^2) )<br>
&nbsp;(intensity or current rate)&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;
(electro-motive force or potential)<br>
&nbsp; = (M * (L^2) ) / (T^3),<br>
which are the dimensions of rate of work or activity. The practical unit<br>
of electric rate of energy or activity is the volt-ampere or watt. By<br>
Ohm's law, q. v., we have C = E/R (C = current; E = potential difference<br>
or electro-motive force; R = resistance.) The watt by definition = C*E.<br>
By substitution from Ohm's formula we deduce for it the following<br>
values: ((C^2) * R) and ((E^2) /R). From these three expressions the<br>
relations of electric energy to E.M.F., Resistance, and Current can be<br>
deduced.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Power of Periodic Current.</span><br>
The rate of energy in a circuit carrying a periodic current. In such a<br>
circuit the electro-motive force travels in advance of the current it<br>
produces on the circuit. Consequently at phases or intervals where,<br>
owing to the alternations of the current, the current is at zero, the<br>
electro-motive force may be quite high. At any time the energy rate is<br>
the product of the electro-motive force by the amperage. To obtain the<br>
power or average rate of energy, the product of the maximum<br>
electro-motive force and maximum current must be divided by two and<br>
multiplied by the cosine of the angle of lag, which is the angle<br>
expressing the difference of phase.<br>
<br>
[Transcriber's note; The voltage phase will lead if the load is<br>
inductive. The current phase will lead if the load is capacitive.<br>
Capacitors or inductors may be introduced into power lines to correct<br>
the phase offset introduced by customer loads.]<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Prony Brake.</span><br>
A device for measuring the power applied to a rotating shaft. It<br>
consists of a clamping device to be applied more or less rigidly to the<br>
shaft or to a pulley upon it. To the clamp is attached a lever carrying<br>
a weight. The cut shows a simple arrangement, the shaft A carries a<br>
pulley B to which the clamp B1 B2 is applied. The nuts C1 C2 are used<br>
for adjustment.<br>
<br>
A weight is placed in the pan E attached to the end of the lever D. The<br>
weight and clamp are so adjusted that the lever shall stand horizontally<br>
as shown by the index E. If we call r the radius of the pulley and F the<br>
friction between its surface and the clamp, it is evident that r F, the<br>
moment of resistance to the motion of the pulley, is equal to the weight<br>
multiplied by its lever arm or to W*R, where W indicates the weight and<br>
R the distance of its point of application from the centre of the pulley<br>
or r*F = R*W. The work represented by this friction is equal to the<br>
distance traveled by the surface of the wheel multiplied by the<br>
frictional resistance, or is 2*PI*r*n*F, in which n is the number of<br>
turns per minute. But this is equal to 2*PI*R*W. These data being known,<br>
the power is directly calculated therefrom in terms of weight and feet<br>

A form of mercurial air pump. It is used for exhausting Geissler tubes,<br>
incandescent lamp bulbs and similar purposes.<br>
<br>
Referring to the cut, A is a reservoir of mercury with flexible tube C<br>
connected to a tube at its bottom, and raised and lowered by a windlass<br>
b, the cord from which passes over a pulley a. When raised the mercury<br>
tends to enter the chamber B, through the tube T. An arrangement of<br>
stopcocks surmounts this chamber, which arrangement is shown on a larger<br>
scale in the three figures X, Y and Z. To fill the bulb B, the cocks are<br>
set in the position Z; n is a two way cock and while it permits the<br>
escape of air below, it cuts off the tube, rising vertically from it.<br>
This tube, d in the full figure connects with a vessel o, pressure gauge<br>
p, and tube c, the latter connecting with the object to be exhausted.<br>
The bulb B being filled, the cock m is closed, giving the position Y and<br>
the vessel A is lowered until it is over 30 inches below B.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Pump, Swinburne.</span><br>
A form of mechanical air pump for exhausting incandescent lamp bulbs.<br>
Referring to the cut, A is a bulb on the upper part of a tube G; above A<br>
are two other bulbs C and D. From the upper end a tube runs to the bulb<br>
E. Through the cock L, and tube F connection is made with a mechanical<br>
air pump. The tube H leads to a drying chamber I, and by the tube J<br>
connects with the lamp bulbs or other objects to be exhausted. The tube<br>
G enters the bottle B through an airtight stopper, through which a<br>
second tube with stopcock K passes. In use a vacuum is produced by the<br>
mechanical pumps, exhausting the lamp bulbs to a half inch and drawing<br>
up the mercury in G. The bent neck in the bulb E, acts with the bulb as<br>
a trap to exclude mercury from F. When the mechanical pumps have<br>
produced a vacuum equal to one half inch of mercury, the cock L is<br>
closed and K is opened, and air at high pressure enters. This forces the<br>
mercury up to the vessel D, half filling it. The high pressure is now<br>
removed and the mercury descends. The valve in D closes it as the<br>
mercury falls to the level G. Further air from the lamps enters A, and<br>
by repetition of the ascent of the mercury, is expelled, through D. The<br>
mercury is again lowered, producing a further exhaustion, and the<br>
process is repeated as often as necessary.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Pyro-electricity.</span><br>
A phenomenon by which certain minerals when warmed acquire electrical<br>
properties. (Ganot.) The mineral tourmaline exhibits it strongly. It was<br>
originally observed in this mineral which was found to first attract and<br>
then to repel hot ashes.<br>
<br>
The phenomenon lasts while any change of temperature within certain<br>
limits is taking place. In the case of tourmaline the range is from<br>
about 10&ordm; C. (50&ordm; F.) to 150&ordm; C. (302&ordm; F.) Above or
below this range it<br>
shows no electrification.<br>
<br>
The effect of a changing of temperature is to develop poles, one<br>
positive and the other negative. As the temperature rises one end is<br>
positive and the other negative; as the temperature becomes constant the<br>
polarity disappears; as the temperature falls the poles are reversed.<br>
<br>
If a piece of tourmaline excited by pyro-electricity is broken, its<br>
broken ends develop new poles exactly like a magnet when broken.<br>
<br>
The following minerals are pyro-electric: Boracite, topaz, prehnite,<br>
zinc silicate, scolezite, axenite. The following compound substances are<br>
also so: Cane sugar, sodium- ammonium racemate and potassium tartrate.<br>
<br>
The list might be greatly extended.<br>
<br>
The phenomenon can be illustrated by sifting through a cotton sieve upon<br>
the excited crystal, a mixture of red lead and flowers of sulphur. By<br>
the friction of the sifting these become oppositely electrified; the<br>
sulphur adheres to the positively electrified end, and the red lead to<br>
the negatively electrified end. (See Analogous Pole-Antilogous Pole.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Pyromagnetic Motor.</span><br>
A motor driven by the alternation of attraction and release of an<br>
armature or other moving part, as such part or a section of it is<br>
rendered more or less paramagnetic by heat.<br>
<br>
Thus imagine a cylinder of nickel at the end of a suspension rod, so<br>
mounted that it can swing like a pendulum. A magnet pole is placed to<br>
one side to which it is attracted. A flame is placed so as to heat it<br>
when in contact with the magnet pole. This destroys its paramagnetism<br>
and it swings away from the magnet and out of the flame. It cools,<br>
becomes paramagnetic, and as it swings back is reattracted, to be again<br>
released as it gets hot enough. This constitutes a simple motor.<br>
<br>
A rotary motor may be made on the same lines. Nickel is particularly<br>
available as losing its paramagnetic property easily.<br>
<br>
<br>
442&nbsp;&nbsp; STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.<br>
<br>
<br>
Various motors have been constructed on this principle, but none have<br>
attained any practical importance. Owing to the low temperature at which<br>
it loses its paramagnetic properties nickel is the best metal for<br>
paramagnetic motors.<br>
<br>
In Edison's motor, between the pole pieces of an electro-magnet a<br>
cylinder made up of a bundle of nickel tubes is mounted, so as to be<br>
free to rotate. A screen is placed so as to close or obstruct the tubes<br>
farthest from the poles. On passing hot air or products of combustion of<br>
a fire or gas flame through the tubes, the unscreened ones are heated<br>
most and lose their paramagnetism. The screened tubes are then attracted<br>
and the armature rotates, bringing other tubes under the screen, which<br>
is stationary. Then the attracted tubes are heated while the others<br>
cool, and a continuous rotation is the result.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Pyromagnetic Generator.</span><br>
A current generator producing electric energy directly from thermal<br>
energy by pyromagnetism.<br>
<br>
Edison's pyromagnetic generator has eight electro-magnets, lying on<br>
eight radii of a circle, their poles facing inward and their yokes<br>
vertical. Only two are shown in the cut. On a horizontal iron disc are<br>
mounted eight vertical rolls of corrugated nickel representing<br>
armatures. On each armature a coil of wire, insulated from the nickel by<br>
asbestus is wound. The coils are all in series, and have eight<br>
connections with a commutator as in a drum armature. There are two main<br>
divisions to the commutator. Each connects with an insulated collecting<br>
ring, and the commutator and collecting rings are mounted on a spindle<br>
rotated by power. Below the circle of vertical coils is a horizontal<br>
screen, mounted on the spindle and rotating with it.<br>
<br>
A source of heat, or a coal stove is directly below the machine and its<br>
hot products of combustion pass up through the coils, some of which are<br>
screened by the rotating screen. The effect is that the coils are<br>
subjecting to induction owing to the change in permeability of the<br>
nickel cores, according as they are heated, or as they cool when the<br>
screen is interposed. The two commutator segments are in constant<br>
relation to the screen, and current is collected therefrom and by the<br>
collecting rings is taken to the outside circuit.<br>

<br>
A battery is connected in quantity when the cells are all in parallel.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Quantity, Electric.</span><br>
Electricity may be measured as if it were a compressible gas, by<br>
determining the potential it produces when stored in a defined<br>
recipient. In this way the conception of a species of quantity is<br>
reached. It is also measured as the quantity of current passed by a<br>
conductor.<br>
<br>
Thus a body whose surface is more or less highly charged with<br>
electricity, is said to hold a greater or less quantity of electricity.<br>
<br>
It may be defined in electrostatic or electro-magnetic terms. (See<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Range Finder.</span><br>
An apparatus for use on shipboard to determine the distance of another<br>
ship or object. It is designed for ships of war, to give the range of<br>
fire, so as to set the guns at the proper elevation. The general<br>
principle involved is the use of the length of the ship if possible, if<br>
not of its width, as a base line. Two telescopes are trained upon the<br>
object and kept trained continuously thereon. The following describes<br>
the Fiske range finder.<br>
<br>
The range finder comprises two fairly powerful telescopes, each mounted<br>
on a standard, which can be rotated round a vertical axis, corresponding<br>
with the center of the large disc shown in the engraving. One-half of<br>
the edge of this disc is graduated to 900 on either side of a zero<br>
point, and below the graduation is fixed a length of platinum silver<br>
wire. This wire only extends to a distance of 81.10 on either side of<br>
zero, and is intended to form two arms of a Wheatstone bridge. The<br>
sliding contact is carried by the same arm as the telescope standards,<br>
so that it moves with the telescope. The two instruments are mounted at<br>
a known distance apart on the ship, as shown diagrammatically in the<br>
cut. Here A and B are the centers of the two discs, C and D the arms<br>
carrying the telescopes, and E and F the platinum silver wires. Suppose<br>
the object is at T, such that A B T is a right angle, then<br>
AT=AB/sin(ATB).<br>
<br>
<br>
448&nbsp;&nbsp; STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.<br>
<br>
<br>
If the two sectors are coupled up as shown, with a battery, h, and a<br>
galvanometer, by the wires, a b and c d, then since the arm, e, on being<br>
aligned on the object takes the position c1 while d remains at zero, the<br>
Wheatstone bridge formed by these segments and their connections will be<br>
out of balance, and a current will flow through the galvanometer, which<br>
may be so graduated as to give the range by direct reading, since the<br>
current through it will increase with the angle A T B.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 389px; height: 673px;" alt=""
 src="images/448F281.jpg"><br>
Fig. 281. RANGE FINDER.<br>
<br>
<br>
In general, however, the angle A B T will not be a right angle, but some<br>
other angle. In this case AT = AB / sin(A T B) * sin( A B T), and hence<br>
it will only be necessary to multiply the range reading on the<br>
galvanometer by the sine of the angle A B T, which can be read directly<br>
by the observer at B. This multiplication is not difficult, but by<br>
suitably arranging his electrical appliances Lieutenant Fiske has<br>
succeeded in getting rid of it, so that the reading of the galvanometer<br>
always gives the range by direct reading, no matter what the angle at B<br>
may be. To explain this, consider the two telescopes shown in the cut in<br>
the positions C and D; the whole current then has a certain resistance.<br>
<br>
<br>
449&nbsp;&nbsp; STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.<br>
<br>
<br>
Next suppose them, still remaining parallel, in the positions C1 and D1.<br>
The total resistance of the circuit is now less than before, and hence<br>
if C1, one of the telescopes, is moved out of parallel to the other,<br>
through a certain angle, the current through the galvanometer will be<br>
greater than if it were moved through an equal angle out of a parallel<br>
when the telescopes were in the positions C and D. The range indicated<br>
is, therefore, decreased, and by properly proportioning the various<br>
parts it is found that the range can always be read direct from the<br>
galvanometer, or in other words the multiplication of A B/sin( A T B )<br>
by sin( A B T ) is to all intents and purposes performed automatically.<br>
There is, it is true, a slight theoretical error; but by using a small<br>
storage battery and making the contents carefully it is said to be<br>
inappreciable. Each telescope is fitted with a telephone receiver and<br>
transmitter, so that both observers can without difficulty decide on<br>
what point to align their telescopes. It will be seen that it is<br>
necessary that the lines of sight of two telescopes should be parallel<br>
when the galvanometer indicates no current. It has been proposed to<br>
accomplish this by sighting both telescopes on a star near the horizon,<br>
which being practically an infinite distance away insures the<br>
parallelism of the lines of sight.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Rate Governor.</span><br>
An apparatus for securing a fixed rate of vibration of a vibrating reed.<br>

swing of the reed. The contact exists during the farthest half of the<br>
swing of the reed away from the attracting pole.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Reaction of Dynamo, Field and Armature.</span><br>
A principle of the dynamo current generator, discovered by Soren Hjorth<br>
of Denmark.<br>
<br>
When the armature is first rotated it moves in a field due to the<br>
residual magnetism of the field magnet core. This field is very weak,<br>
and a slight current only is produced. This passing in part or in whole<br>
through the field magnet cores slightly strengthens the field, whose<br>
increased strength reacts on the armature increasing its current, which<br>
again strengthens the field. In this way the current very soon reaches<br>
its full strength as due to its speed of rotation.<br>
<br>
The operation is sometimes termed building up.<br>

Sometimes, when there is but a trace of residual magnetism, it is very<br>
hard to start a dynamo.<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Reading Telescope.</span><br>
A telescope for reading the deflections of a reflecting galvanometer.<br>
<br>
A long horizontal scale is mounted at a distance from the galvanometer<br>
and directly below or above the centre of the scale a telescope is<br>
mounted. The telescope is so directed that the mirror of the<br>
galvanometer is in its field of view, and the relative positions of<br>
mirror, scale and telescope are such that the image of the scale in the<br>
galvanometer mirror is seen by the observer looking through the<br>
telescope.<br>
<br>
Under these conditions it is obvious that the graduation of the scale<br>
reflected by the mirror corresponds to the deflection of the<br>
galvanometer needle.<br>
<br>
The scale may be straight or curved, with the galvanometer in the latter<br>
case, at its centre of curvature.<br>

<br>
A riband or strip of paper is drawn over a roller which is slightly<br>
indented around its centre. A stylus or blunt point carried by a<br>
vibrating arm nearly touches the paper. The arm normally is motionless<br>
and makes no mark on the paper. An armature is carried by the arm and an<br>
electro-magnet faces the armature. When a current is passed through the<br>
magnet the armature is attracted and the stylus is forced against the<br>
paper, depressing it into the groove, thus producing a mark. When the<br>
current ceases the stylus is drawn back by a spring.<br>

In some instruments a small inking roller takes the place of the stylus,<br>
and the roller is smooth. The cut, Fig. 285, shows the plan view of the<br>
ink-roller mechanism. J is the roller, L is the ink well, Cl is the arm<br>
by which it is raised or lowered by the electro-magnet, as in the<br>

the arm carrying the armature is secured, projecting to the right. A<br>
spring is arranged to rub against the edge of the inking roller and<br>
remove the ink from it.<br>

The paper is fed through the apparatus by clockwork. At the present day<br>
sound reading has almost entirely replaced the sight reading of the<br>

A recording apparatus in which the inked marks are made on a strip of<br>

In the cut N S represents the poles of a powerful electro-magnet. A<br>
rectangular coil bb of wire is suspended between the coils. A stationary<br>
iron core a intensifies the field. The suspension wire f f 1 has its<br>
tension adjusted at h. This wire acts as conductor for the current.<br>
<br>
<br>
453&nbsp;&nbsp; STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.<br>
<br>
<br>
The current is sent in one or the other direction or is cut off in<br>
practice to produce the desired oscillations of the coil b b. A glass<br>
siphon n l works upon a vertical axis l. One end l is immersed in an ink<br>
well m. Its longer end n touches a riband of paper o o. The thread k<br>
attached to one side of the coil pulls the siphon back and forth<br>
according to the direction of current going through the electro-magnet<br>
cores. A spiral spring adjusted by a hand-screw controls the siphon. In<br>
operation the siphon is drawn back and forth producing a zigzag line.<br>
The upward marks represent dots, the downward ones dashes. Thus the<br>
Telegraphic Code can be transmitted on it. To cause the ink to issue<br>
properly, electrification by a static machine has been used, when the<br>
stylus does not actually touch the paper, but the ink is ejected in a<br>
series of dots.<br>

There are various kinds of electric registers, for registering the<br>
movements of watchmen and other service. Contact or press buttons may be<br>
distributed through a factory. Each one is connected so that when the<br>
circuit is closed thereby a mark is produced by the depression of a<br>
pencil upon a sheet or disc of paper by electro-magnetic mechanism. The<br>
paper is moved by clockwork, and is graduated into hours. For each<br>
push-button a special mark may be made on the paper. The watchman is<br>
required to press the button at specified times. This indicates his<br>
movements on the paper, and acts as a time detector to show whether he<br>
has been attending to his duty.<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Regulation, Constant Current.</span><br>
The regulation of a dynamo so that it shall give a constant current<br>
against any resistance in the outer circuits, within practical limits.<br>
It is carried out in direct current machines generally by independent<br>
regulators embodying a controlling coil with plunger or some equivalent<br>
electro-magnetic device inserted in the main circuit and necessarily of<br>
low resistance. In some regulators the work of moving the regulator is<br>
executed mechanically, but under electrical control; in others the<br>
entire work is done by the current.<br>
<br>
A typical regulator or governor (Golden's) of the first class comprises<br>
two driven friction wheels between which is a driving friction wheel,<br>
which can engage with one driven wheel only at once. It is brought into<br>
engagement with one or the other by a solenoid and plunger.<br>
<br>
<br>
455&nbsp;&nbsp; STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.<br>
<br>
<br>
As it touches one wheel it turns it in one direction. This moves a<br>
sliding contact in one direction so as to increase a resistance. This<br>
corresponds to a motion of the plunger in one direction. As the driving<br>
wheel moves in the opposite direction by a reverse action it diminishes<br>
the resistance. Thus the increase and decrease of resistance correspond<br>
to opposite movements of the solenoid plunger, and consequently to<br>
opposite variations in the current. The whole is so adjusted that the<br>
variations in resistance maintain a constant amperage. The resistance is<br>
in the exciting circuit of the dynamo.<br>
<br>
In Brush's regulator, which is purely mechanical, a series dynamo is<br>
made to give a constant current by introducing across the field magnets<br>
a shunt of variable resistance, whose resistance is changed by an<br>
electro-magnet, whose coils are in circuit with the main current. Carbon<br>
resistance discs are used which the electro-magnet by its attraction for<br>
its armature, presses with varying intensity. This alters the<br>
resistance, decreasing it as the current increases and the reverse. As<br>
the connection is in shunt this action goes to maintain a constant<br>
current.<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Regulation, Constant Potential.</span><br>
The regulation of constant potential dynamos is executed on the same<br>
lines as that of constant current dynamos. If done by a controlling<br>
coil, it must for constant potential regulation be wound with fine wire<br>
and connected as a shunt for some part of the machine.<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Regulation of Dynamos.</span><br>
The regulation of dynamos so that they shall maintain a constant<br>
potential difference in the leads of their circuit for multiple arc<br>
systems or shall deliver a constant current in series systems. Hence two<br>
different systems of regulation are required, (a) constant potential<br>
regulation--(b) constant current regulation. The first named is by far<br>
the more important, as it concerns multiple arc lighting, which is the<br>
system universally used for incandescent lighting.<br>
<br>
S. P. Thompson thus summarizes the methods of governing or regulating<br>
dynamos. Premising that alteration of the magnetic flux is the almost<br>
universal way of control, it can be done in two ways; first, by varying<br>
the excitation or ampere turns of the field, and second by varying the<br>
reluctance of the magnetic circuit. The excitation or magnetic flux may<br>
be varied<br>
<br>
(a) by hand, with the aid of rheostats and commutators in the exciting<br>
circuit;<br>
<br>
(b) automatically, by governors, taking the place of the hand;<br>
<br>
(c) by compound windings. The magnetic circuit may have its reluctance<br>
caused to vary in several ways;<br>
<br>
(d) by moving the pole pieces nearer to or further from the armature;<br>
<br>
(e) by opening or closing some gap in the magnetic circuit (field-magnet<br>
core);<br>
<br>
(f) by drawing the armature endways from between the pole pieces;<br>
<br>
(g) by shunting some of the magnetic lines away from the armature by a<br>
magnetic shunt.<br>
<br>
The latter magnetic circuit methods d, e, f, and g, have never met with<br>
much success except on small machines or motors. Method e is adopted in<br>
the Edison motor, the yoke being withdrawn or brought nearer the cores<br>
of the coils. (See Regulation, Constant Current-Regulation, constant<br>
Potential.)<br>

<br>
<br>
The typical relay includes an electro-magnet and armature. To the latter<br>
an arm is attached and the lower end of the arm works in pivots. As the<br>
armature is attracted the arm swings towards the magnet. When the<br>
current is cut off, the armature and arm are drawn back by a spring.<br>
When the arm swings towards the magnet its upper end touching a contact<br>
screw closes the local circuit. When it swings back it comes in contact<br>
with a second screw, with insulated point, and opens the circuit as it<br>
leaves the first named screw.<br>
<br>
One terminal connects with the arm through the pivots and frame. The<br>
other connects with the contact screw through the frame carrying it.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Relay, Polarized.</span><br>
A relay whose armature is of steel, and polarized or permanently<br>
magnetized, or in which a permanent magnet is used as the basis for the<br>
electro-magnets. In the relay shown in the cut the coils shown are<br>
mounted on cores carried on the end of a powerful bent permanent magnet.<br>
Thus when no current passes their upper poles are both of the same sign,<br>
and the horizontally vibrating tongue is held by the magnetic attraction<br>
against one or the other pole piece. If a current is sent through the<br>
electro-magnet it gives opposite polarity to the two polar extensions.<br>
As the end of the vibrating tongue is of polarity determined by the<br>
permanent magnet it is attracted to one pole and&nbsp; repelled from the<br>
other. On cessation of current it remains attached by the permanent<br>
magnetism. If now a current is sent in the opposite direction the two<br>
poles again acquire opposite polarity, the reverse of the former, and<br>
the tongue flies across to the opposite side. On cessation of current it<br>
remains attached as before by the permanent magnetism.<br>
<br>
In its movements to and fro the relay tongue opens and closes a contact,<br>
so as to work a sounder or other apparatus. The polarized relay is of<br>
high sensibility, and requires little or no change of adjustment.<br>

In a magnetic circuit or portion thereof, the resistance offered to the<br>
flow of lines of force. The magnetic circuit as has already been stated<br>
is treated like an electric circuit, and in it reluctance occupies the<br>
place of resistance in the electric circuit. It is the reciprocal of<br>
permeance. S. P. Thompson expresses the law thus:<br>
<br>
Total number of magnetic lines = (magneto-motive force) / (magnetic<br>
reluctance)<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Reluctance, Unit of.</span><br>
The reluctance of a circuit through which unit magnetizing power<br>
(magneto-motive force) can produce a unit of induction or one line of<br>
force. This value is very high; the reluctance of ordinary magnetic<br>
circuits ranges from 1E-5 to 1E-8 unit of reluctance.<br>

relation to reluctance that permeability does to permeance.<br>
<br>
It is defined as the reciprocal of magnetic permeability. (Kenelly.) If<br>
plotted as a curve for different values of the magnetizing force it is<br>
found to be nearly a straight line, a linear function of the magnetizing<br>
force, H with the equation a + b H. Reluctivity is the property of a<br>
substance; reluctance is the property of a circuit.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Repeater.</span><br>
In telegraphy an instrument for repeating the signals through a second<br>
line. It is virtually a relay which is operated by the sender, and which<br>
in turn operates the rest of the main line, being situated itself at<br>
about the middle point of the distance covered. In the simpler forms of<br>
repeater two relays are used, one for transmission in one direction the<br>
other for transmission in the other. An attendant switches one or the<br>
other in as required.<br>
<br>
Thus a common relay is virtually a repeater for its local circuit. If<br>
such a relay is placed half way down a line, and if the line beyond it<br>
is connected as its local, it becomes a repeater.<br>
<br>
Some forms of repeaters are automatic, and repeat both ways without the<br>
need of an attendant.<br>
<br>
It is the practice to somewhat prolong the signals sent through a<br>
repeater.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Replenisher, Sir William Thomson's.</span><br>
A static accumulating influence machine contained in Thomson's quadrant<br>
electrometer and used to change the quadrants. The cut shows the<br>
horizontal section and construction of the apparatus.<br>
<br>
It contains two gilt brass inductors A B, and two eccentric sectors or<br>
carriers, C, D, which are mounted on an ebonite spindle, which is spun<br>
around by the fingers. The springs s s1 connect each with its inductor;<br>
the springs S S1 connect only each other, and touch the sectors as they<br>
turn around.<br>
<br>
One of the inductors may be always assumed to be of slightly higher<br>
potential than that of the other one. When the carriers are in contact<br>
with the springs S S1 they are each charged by induction with<br>
electricity opposite in sign to that of the nearest quadrant. As they<br>
leave the springs S S1 in their rotation, they next touch the springs s<br>
s1, but of the recently opposite inductor. They share each a portion of<br>
its charge with the inductors building up their charges. The action is<br>
repeated over and over again as they rotate.<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Resistance.</span><br>
(a) The quality of an electric conductor, in virtue of which it opposes<br>
the passage of an electric current, causing the disappearance of<br>
electro-motive force if a current passes through it, and converting<br>
electric energy into heat energy in the passage of a current through it.<br>
If a current passes through a conductor of uniform resistance there is a<br>
uniform fall of potential all along its length. If of uneven resistance<br>
the fall in potential varies with the resistance. (See Potential, Fall<br>
of.)<br>
<br>
The fall of potential is thus expressed by Daniell. "In a conductor, say<br>
a wire, along which a current is steadily and uniformly passing, there<br>
is no internal accumulation of electricity, no density of internal<br>
distribution; there is, on the other hand, an unequally distributed<br>
charge of electricity on the surface of the wire, which results in a<br>
potential diminishing within the wire from one end of the wire to the<br>
other."<br>
<br>
Resistance varies inversely with the cross section of a cylindrical or<br>
prismatic conductor, in general with the average cross-section of any<br>
conductor, and in the same sense directly with its true or average or<br>
virtual length. It varies for different substances, and for different<br>
conditions as of temperature and pressure for the same substance. A rise<br>
of temperature in metals increases the resistance, in some bad<br>
conductors a rise of temperature decreases the resistance.<br>
<br>
<br>
462&nbsp;&nbsp; STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.<br>
<br>
<br>
Approximately, with the exception of iron and mercury, the resistance of<br>
a metallic conductor varies with the absolute temperature. This is very<br>
roughly approximate.<br>
<br>
Except for resistance energy would not be expended in maintaining a<br>
current through a circuit. The resistance of a conductor may be supposed<br>
to have its seat and cause in the jumps from molecule to molecule, which<br>
the current has to take in going through it. If so a current confined to<br>
a molecule would, if once started, persist because there would be no<br>
resistance in a molecule. Hence on this theory the Amp&eacute;rian
currents<br>
(see Magnetism, Ampere's Theory of) would require no energy for their<br>
maintenance and Amp&eacute;re's theory would become a possible truth.<br>
<br>
When metals melt their resistance suddenly increases.<br>
<br>
Light rays falling on some substances, notably selenium, q. v., vary the<br>
resistance.<br>
<br>
Longitudinal stretching of a conductor decreases it, it increases with<br>
longitudinal compression, and increases in iron and diminishes in tin<br>
and zinc when a transverse stress tends to widen the conductor.<br>
<br>
(b) The term resistance is used to express any object or conductor used<br>
in circuit to develop resistance.<br>
<br>
[Transcriber's note: At room temperatures, the thermal motion of ions in<br>
the conductor's crystal lattice scatters the electrons of the current.<br>
Imperfections of the lattice contribute slightly. At low temperatures<br>
superconductivity (zero resistance) can occur because an energy gap<br>
between the electrons and the crystal lattice prevents any interaction.<br>
At the time of this book, none of this was known. "Jumps from molecule<br>
to molecule" is a good guess.]<br>

A set of phenomena known as the Hertz experiments are grouped under this<br>
title, which phenomena are incidents of and depend on the propagation of<br>
electric waves through wires or current conductors, as well as through<br>
the ether. Ordinarily a wire is only a seat of current, and is in its<br>
nature inconsistent with wave propagation through its mass. Such waves<br>
are virtually confined to the exterior of the wire. The point is that<br>
the current-producing force is supposed to enter the wire at all points<br>
from without, the current not being produced by an end-push. Hence in<br>
rapidly recurring waves which are produced by a rapidly pulsatory or<br>
alternating current, no time is afforded for the current-producing<br>
force, in this case the wave-producing force, to penetrate into the<br>
substance of the wire. In one of his experiments Dr. Hertz surrounded a<br>
wire by a glass tube chemically silvered. The coating was so thin as to<br>
be translucent. Through this metallic layer a current could be induced<br>
in the wire in its interior. Any mechanical layer of metal took up the<br>
induction itself, and protected the central wire. This gave a clue to<br>
the thickness of metal penetrated by the rapid induced waves used by Dr.<br>
Hertz.<br>

Fig. 295. ELECTRICAL RESONANCE EXCITER.<br>
<br>
<br>
The method used for the production of rapid oscillations is the<br>
following. To the terminals of an induction coil two metal spheres AA1<br>
are connected as shown. This apparatus is termed the exciter; in its<br>
discharge a series of isochronous discharges takes place, alternating in<br>
direction. The period of duration T of a single one is given by the<br>
formula T= 2* PI * squareRoot( LC ),&nbsp; in which C is the capacity
and L<br>
is the self-induction. The spheres may be 30 centimeters (11.8 inches)<br>
in diameter, connected each to conductors 0.5 centimeter (.2 inch) in<br>
diameter and 40 centimeters (15.7 inches) long each. For the length of<br>
an undulation the formula gives for this apparatus 4.8 meters (15.75<br>
feet) as the length of a wave, assuming for them the velocity of<br>
propagation equal to that of light. The exciter may have 10,000 times<br>
the rate of oscillation possessed by the plain induction coil.<br>
<br>
When this apparatus is worked it produces induced waves in every<br>
neighboring conductor. The resonance effects appear in the size of the<br>
spark induced. Thus a wire bent into a circle with its ends nearly<br>
touching will give a spark, but if made of proper electrostatic<br>
capacity, corresponding with the particular waves employed, the spark<br>
will be very much larger. The ring, with its spark gap is termed a<br>
resonator. It is used as an explorer to trace the waves.<br>
<br>
Waves thus produced are transmitted by stone walls and nonconductors in<br>
general. A plate of zinc reflects part and transmits part. The reflected<br>
waves can be traced by the resonator, their angle of reflection being<br>
equal to their angle of incidence. They can be received by one parabolic<br>
reflector, reflected to another and brought to a focus. They can be<br>
reflected so as to produce interference or loops and nodes, and the<br>
loops and nodes can be traced by the resonator. By a prism of asphalt<br>
they are refracted exactly like light.<br>
<br>
From all this it is concluded that an additional proof is furnished of<br>
the identity of light and electro-magnetic waves, and a very strong<br>
experimental proof of Maxwell's theory of light is furnished.<br>

A small open electric circuit, with ends nearly touching. When exposed<br>
to electric resonance, or to a sympathetic electric oscillatory<br>
discharge, a spark passes from across the gap. The production of this<br>

<br>
<br>
R<span style="font-weight: bold;">etardation.</span><br>
In telegraphy a retardation of the rate of transmission of signals. It<br>
is due to several causes.<br>
<br>
(a) The self-induction of the circuit, especially if it includes many<br>
electro-magnets, produces extra currents (see Currents, Extra.) These<br>
are opposed to the main current on closing it and hence retard the<br>
action. They are in the same direction on opening it and hence again<br>
retard the action.<br>
<br>
(b) Every line has a certain static capacity. This is affected by the<br>
proximity of the lines to the earth. For each signal electricity has to<br>
be charged upon the line until the line is charged to its end with a<br>
certain proportion of the initial density. This charging takes time and<br>
hence introduces retardation.<br>
<br>
(c) The cores of the electro-magnets of the relays or sounders are not<br>
instantly magnetized and demagnetized. This magnetic lag, q. v.,<br>
introduces retardation.<br>

is suspended by one end. Its lower end just dips into a mercury cup. An<br>
active circuit is connected, one terminal to the upper end, the other<br>
terminal to the mercury cup, bringing the apparatus in series into the<br>

spiral attracting its neighbors. This breaks the circuit by drawing the<br>
lower end out of the mercury cup. The current being cut off the coils<br>
cease to attract each other, and the end dips into the mercury cup<br>
again. This closes the circuit, the coils again attract each other and<br>
the same sequence follows and is repeated over and over again. A bright<br>
spark is produced at each break of the mercury contact.<br>

By passing a current through a liquid, such as dilute sulphuric acid, it<br>
rotates if exposed to the induction of a current flowing at right angles<br>
to it. The condition resolves itself into a liquid traversed by<br>
horizontal currents from centre to circumference or vice versa, rotated<br>
by a current passing through a circular conductor below it.<br>

(a) A device to prevent overheating of any portion of a circuit by<br>
excess of current. It generally consists of a slip of fusible metal<br>
which if the current attains too much strength melts and opens the<br>
circuit. To ensure its breaking a weight is sometimes suspended from the<br>
strip. In one form an insulated German silver wire is wrapped around the<br>
end of the fusible strip a number of times and its end is connected to<br>
it. The other end of the German silver wire connects with the main lead,<br>
so that all the current goes through both in series. If the German<br>
silver wire becomes heated from excess of current the coil wrapped<br>
tightly around the end of the fusible strip melts it and opens the<br>
circuit.<br>

dissolving some salts in hot water and allowing the solution to cool<br>
without access of air, to obtain a supersaturated solution. On<br>
introduction of a crystal of the salt, or often on mere access of air,<br>
the solution forms crystals and the liquid left is saturated.<br>

Fig. 300. WIRE GAUZE ELECTRIC SCREEN.<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Screen, Electric.</span><br>
A large plate or a hollow case or cage of conducting material connected<br>
with the earth, and used to protect any body placed within it from<br>
electrostatic influences.<br>
<br>
If within a hollow conducting sphere an electrified body is placed, the<br>
inner surface of the sphere will be charged with electricity of opposite<br>
kind to that of the sphere, and the outer surface with the same kind as<br>
that of the sphere. Thus the sum of the electricities called into action<br>
by induction is zero. The two inner charges are bound to each other. The<br>
induced charge on the outer surface of the sphere is all that has any<br>
effect on objects in the outer air.<br>
<br>
If the outer surface is connected to the earth it becomes discharged,<br>
and however highly electrified the body introduced into the sphere and<br>
the inner surface of such sphere may be, they produce no external<br>
effects, as they are bound one to the other.<br>
<br>
If the sphere is connected to the earth and an unelectrified object is<br>
placed within it, such object will be perfectly shielded from the<br>
effects of an outer electrostatic field. Perforated tinfoil or wire<br>
gauze has just as good a result. A large plate of metal connected to the<br>
earth has the same effect. The screen whether plane or hollow simply<br>
retains a bound charge due to the field of force, thereby neutralizing<br>
it, and the electricity of the opposite sign escapes to the earth. Thus<br>
a true shielding or screening effect is produced.<br>
<br>
In the cut an experiment is shown in which an electric screen is carried<br>
by a Leyden jar. Pith balls are suspended outside and inside of it. By<br>
the approach of an electrified body the outer pith balls will diverge,<br>
while no effect is produced upon the inner ones.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Secondary Actions.</span><br>
In electrolysis the direct products of the electrical decomposition are<br>
not always obtained at the electrodes, but products due to their<br>
reaction on the water and other chemicals may appear. These constitute<br>
secondary actions. Thus if a solution of copper sulphate is electrolyzed<br>
with platinum electrodes, metallic copper appears at one pole and<br>
sulphuric acid and oxygen gas at the other. But the products of<br>
electrolysis by the current are copper (Cu) and sulphion (SO4). The<br>
latter reacting on water sets free oxygen gas and forms sulphuric acid.<br>
The latter is a secondary action.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Secondary Generator.</span><br>
(a) An alternating current converter generating a so-called secondary<br>

The term movable secondaries has been applied to rings, spheres and<br>
discs of conducting material, such as copper, whose behavior when near<br>
the pole of an electro-magnet traversed by an alternating current, have<br>
been studied by Elihu Thomson. Such masses are subjected to very<br>
peculiar movements and mutual reactions. As the phenomena are due to<br>
induced currents the above term has been applied to the masses in which<br>
the currents are induced.<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Selenium.</span><br>
A non-metallic element. It is interesting electrically on account of the<br>
changes its electric resistance undergoes when it is subjected to light.<br>
<br>
In one set of experiments it was found that diffused light caused the<br>
resistance to fall in the ratio of 11 to 9. Full sunlight reduced it to<br>
one-half. Of the spectrum colors red was most powerful and the ultra red<br>
region still more strongly affected its resistance.<br>
<br>
The effect produced by exposure to light is instantaneous, but on<br>
removal to the dark only slowly disappears.<br>
<br>
A vessel of hot water was found to have no effect, showing that short<br>
ether waves are essential to the effect.<br>

conductor.<br>
<br>
Its resistance can then be determined. It decreases in sunlight to about<br>
one-half its resistance in the dark.<br>

female of the insect coccus ficus or c. lacca.<br>
<br>
Commercial shellac contains about 90 per cent. of resinous material, the<br>
rest is made up of wax, gluten, coloring matter and other substances.<br>
<br>
Shellac is soluble in alcohol, and in aqueous solutions of ammonium<br>
chloride, of borax and in strong ammonia solution. Long standing is<br>
required in the case of the last named solvent. Dilute hydrochloric and<br>
acetic acids dissolve it readily; nitric acid slowly; strong sulphuric<br>
acid is without action on it. Alkalies dissolve it.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Short Circuit Working.</span><br>
A method of working intermittently an electro-magnet so as to avoid<br>
sparking. It consists in providing a short circuit in parallel with the<br>
magnetic coils. This short circuit is of very low resistance. To throw<br>
the magnet into action the short circuit is opened; to throw it out of<br>
action the short circuit is closed. The shunt or short circuit must be<br>
of negligibly small resistance and inductance.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Shunt.</span><br>
In a current circuit a connection in parallel with a portion of the<br>
circuit. Thus in a dynamo a special winding for the field may have its<br>
ends connected to the bushes, from which the regular external circuit<br>
also starts. The field is then wound in shunt with the armature. In the<br>
case of a galvanometer a resistance coil may be put in parallel with it<br>
to prevent too much current going through the galvanometer; this<br>
connection is a shunt.<br>
<br>
The word is used as a noun, as "a shunt," or "a connection or apparatus<br>
in shunt with another," and as an adjective, as "a shunt connection," or<br>
as a verb, as "to shunt a battery."<br>
<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Shunt, Electro-magnetic.</span><br>
In telegraphy a shunt for the receiving relay consisting of the coils of<br>
an electro-magnet. It is placed in parallel with the relay. Its poles<br>
are permanently connected by an armature. Thus it has high<br>
self-induction.<br>
<br>
On opening and closing the circuit by the sending key, extra currents<br>
are produced in the shunt. The connections are so arranged that on<br>
making the circuit the extra current goes through the relay in the same<br>
direction as the principal current, while on breaking the circuit the<br>
induced current goes in the opposite direction.<br>
<br>
Thus the extra currents accelerate the production and also the cessation<br>
of signalling currents, tending to facilitate the operations of sending<br>
despatches.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Shunt, Galvanometer.</span><br>
A resistance placed in parallel with a galvanometer, so as to short<br>

Various baths are used to remove silver from old electroplated articles.<br>

Silvered iron articles are placed as anodes in a solution of 1 part<br>
potassium cyanide in 20 parts of water. As kathode a silver anode or a<br>
copper one lightly oiled may be used. From the latter the silver easily<br>
rubs off. For copper articles a mixture of fuming sulphuric acid and<br>
nitric acid (40&ordm; Beaum&eacute;) may be used. The presence of any
water in this<br>
mixture will bring about the solution of the copper. Or fuming sulphuric<br>
acid may be heated to between 300&ordm; and 400&ordm; F., some pinches
of dry<br>
pulverized potassium nitrate may be thrown in and the articles at once<br>
dipped. These methods effect the solution of the silver, leaving the<br>
copper unattacked.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Simple Substitution.</span><br>
A method of obtaining a resistance equal to that of a standard. The<br>
standard is put in circuit with a galvanometer and the deflection is<br>
noted. For the standard another wire is substituted and its length<br>
altered until the same deflection is produced. The two resistances are<br>
then evidently identical. The standard can be again substituted to<br>

<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Sine Curve.</span><br>
If we imagine a point moved back and forth synchronously with a<br>
pendulum, and if such point made a mark upon paper, it would trace the<br>
same line over and over again. If now the paper were drawn steadily<br>
along at right angles to the line of motion of the point, then the point<br>
would trace upon it a line like the profile of a wave. Such line is a<br>
sine curve. It derives its name from the following construction. Let a<br>
straight line be drawn, and laid off in fractions, such as degrees, of<br>
the perimeter of a circle of given diameter. Then on each division of<br>
the line let a perpendicular be erected equal in height to the sine of<br>
the angle of the circle corresponding to that division; then if the<br>
extremities of such lines be united by a curve such curve will be a sine<br>
curve.<br>
<br>
In such a curve the abscissas are proportional to the times, while the<br>
ordinates are proportional to the sines of angles, which angles are<br>
themselves proportional to the times. The ordinates pass through<br>
positive and negative values alternately, while the abscissas are always<br>
positive.<br>
<br>
Any number of sine curves can be constructed by varying the diameter of<br>
the original circle, or by giving to the abscissas a value which is a<br>
multiple of the true length of the divisions of circle. If the pendulum<br>
method of construction were used this would be attained by giving a<br>
greater or less velocity to the paper as drawn under the pendulum.<br>
<br>
A species of equation for the curve is given as follows: y = sin( x )<br>
<br>
In this x really indicates the arc whose length is x, and reference<br>
should be made to the value of the radius of the circle from which the<br>
curve is described. It will also be noticed that the equation only<br>
covers the case in which the true divisions of the circle are laid off<br>
on the line. If a multiple of such divisions are used, say n times, or<br>
1-n times, then the equation should read <br>
y = n sin( x ) or y = sin( x ) / n<br>

A theory of electricity. Electricity, as has been said, being<br>
conveniently treated as a fluid or fluids, the single fluid theory<br>
attributes electrical phenomena to the presence or absence of a single<br>
fluid. The fluid repels itself but attracts matter; an excess creates<br>
positive, a deficiency, negative electrification; friction, contact<br>
action or other generating cause altering the distribution creates<br>
potential difference or electrification. The assumed direction (see<br>
Direction) of the current and of lines of force are based on the single<br>

Fig. 305. EXPERIMENTAL SOLENOID.<br>
<br>
<br>
The simple solenoid as constructed of wire, is a helical coil, of<br>
uniform diameter, so as to represent a cylinder. After completing the<br>
coil one end of the wire is bent back and carried through the centre of<br>
the coil, bringing thus both ends out at the same end. The object of<br>
doing this is to cause this straight return member to neutralize the<br>
longitudinal component of the helical turns. This it does approximately<br>
so as to cause the solenoid for its practical action to correspond with<br>
the ideal solenoid.<br>
<br>
Instead of carrying one end of the wire through the centre of the coil<br>
as just described, both ends may be bent back and brought together at<br>
the centre.<br>
<br>
A solenoid should always have this neutralization of the longitudinal<br>
component of the helices provided for; otherwise it is not a true<br>
solenoid.<br>
<br>
Solenoids are used in experiments to represent magnets and to study and<br>
illustrate their laws. When a current goes through them they acquire<br>
polarity, attract iron, develop lines of force and act in general like<br>
magnets.<br>

Fig. 306. MORSE SOUNDER.<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Sounder.</span><br>
In telegraphy an instrument consisting of an electromagnet with armature<br>
attached to an oscillating bar, the range of whose movements is<br>
restricted by adjusting screws. The armature is drawn away from the<br>
magnet by a spring. When a current is sent through the magnet the<br>
armature is drawn towards the poles and produces a sound as the bar<br>
strikes a striking piece or second adjusting screw. When the current<br>
ceases the bar and armature are drawn back, striking the first mentioned<br>
screw with a distinct sound, the back stroke.<br>
<br>
The sounder is used to receive Morse and analogous character messages.<br>
The forward strokes correspond to the beginnings of the dots or dashes<br>
of the code, the back strokes to beginnings of the intervals. The<br>
distinction between dots and dashes is made by observing the interval<br>
between forward and back stroke.<br>
<br>
Various devices are used to increase the sound. Sometimes a resonance<br>
box is used on which the sounder is mounted.<br>

In practice sounders are generally placed on local circuits and are<br>
actuated by relays.<br>

In dynamo-electric machines, the production of sparks at the commutator<br>
between the brushes and commutator sections. The sparks are often true<br>

In a dynamo or electric motor the diameter of the commutator<br>
determining, or the points on the commutator marking the position of the<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Spark, Length of.</span><br>
The length of the spark accompanying the disruptive discharge is counted<br>
as the distance from one electrode to the other in a straight line. It<br>
is longer for an increased potential difference between the two<br>
electrodes. If the gas or air between the electrodes is exhausted the<br>
length increases, until the vacuum becomes too high, when the length<br>
begins to decrease, and for a perfect vacuum no spark however small can<br>
be produced. The shape of the conductor which is discharged, the<br>
material of the electrodes, and the direction of the current are all<br>
factors affecting the length of spark producible.<br>

chamber of the lamps in process of exhaustion, and hence shares their<br>
degree of exhaustion. From time to time connections with an induction<br>

The heat absorbed or given out by a fluid in passing from one<br>
temperature to another depends on its specific heat. In the Peltier and<br>

A compound of iron with carbon. The carbon may range from a few<br>
hundredths of one per cent. up to two per cent. For magnets, tool steel<br>
drawn to a straw color or a little lower is good. All shaping and filing<br>
should be done before magnetization.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Steeling.</span><br>
The deposition of iron on copper plates by electrolysis. In<br>
electrotyping a thin deposit of iron is thus given the relief plates<br>
before printing from them. The deposit is very hard and exceedingly<br>
thin, so that it does not interfere with the perfection of the<br>
impression in the printing process. As the iron becomes worn it can be<br>
dissolved off with hydrochloric acid, which does not dissolve the<br>
copper, and a new deposit can be given it. Thus the plate may last for<br>
an indefinite number of impressions.<br>
<br>
The iron bath may be prepared by immersing in a solution of ammonium<br>
chloride, two plates of iron, connected as anode and kathode in a<br>
circuit. One plate dissolves while hydrogen is given off from the other.<br>
The solution thus produced is used for a bath.<br>
<br>
The hardness of the deposit, which is really pure iron, gives the name<br>
of "steeling."<br>

spring for drawing back the armature, or to imperfect breaking of the<br>
contact by the despatcher's key or by the receiver's relay.<br>

Properly speaking electricity can only be stored statically or in static<br>
condensers, such as Leyden jars. The term has been popularly applied to<br>

A conception bearing the same relation to an electric current that lines<br>
of force do to a field of force; elementary currents. If evenly<br>
distributed the current is of uniform density; if unevenly distributed,<br>
as in alternating currents, the current density varies in different<br>
parts of the cross section of the conductor. This evenness or unevenness<br>
may be referred to the number of streamlets per unit of area of<br>
cross-section.<br>

In silver-plating a bath composed of a weak solution of silver<br>
cyanide-with a large proportion of free potassium cyanide. It is used<br>
with a strong current and a large silver anode. This gives an<br>
instantaneous deposition of metallic silver over the surface of the<br>
article which goes to insure a perfect coating in the silver bath<br>

connected as the anode to the positive plate of the battery or<br>
corresponding terminal of the generator. A kathode connected to the<br>
other terminal being placed in the bath, the coating is dissolved by<br>
electrolytic action. Sometimes simple treatment with acid is employed.<br>
Different stripping baths are described under the heads of the different<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Subway, Electric.</span><br>
A subterranean system of conduits for electric cables. As generally<br>
constructed in this country it includes manholes, q. v., at the street<br>
corners connected by ducts or pipes. These pipes are large enough to<br>
hold a cable. To introduce a cable into a duct, which latter may be two<br>
or three inches in diameter, and from two hundred to six or seven<br>
hundred feet long, a wire or rope is first passed through the duct. This<br>
is done by a set of short wooden rods with screws at the end so as to be<br>
screwed together. Each rod must be shorter than the diameter of the<br>
manhole. A rod is thrust in, another is screwed to it and thrust in, and<br>
thus a set of rods is made to extend as far as desired. In pulling them<br>
out a rope is attached and drawn through. This rope or a larger one is<br>
used in drawing the cable through the duct. A windlass is employed to<br>
draw the rope with cable attached through the ducts.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Sulphating.</span><br>
In storage battery cells, the formation of a hard white basic lead<br>
sulphate, Pb2 S05. Its formation is due to over-exhaustion of the cells.<br>
As long as the voltage is not allowed to fall below 1.90 volts per cell<br>
little of it forms. As it accumulates it is apt to drop off the plate<br>
and fall to the bottom, thus weakening the plate possibly, and depriving<br>
it of active material, and clogging up the cell. If it carries a film of<br>
metallic lead with it, there is danger of short circuiting the cell.<br>
<br>
The presence of some sodium sulphate in the solution is said to tend to<br>
prevent sulphating, or to diminish it.<br>

A surface over all of which the potential is the same. In a general<br>
sense equipotential surfaces are given by planes or surfaces which cut<br>
lines of force at right angles thereto, or which are normal to lines of<br>
force. The conception applies to electrostatic and electro-magnetic<br>
fields of force, and for current conductors the planes normal to the<br>
direction of the current are equipotential surfaces.<br>
<br>
The contour of an equipotential surface of a field of force which is<br>
drawn or represented by delineations of its lines of force can be<br>
obtained by drawing a line normal thereto. This line will ordinarily be<br>
more or less curved, and will be a locus of identical potentials.<br>
<br>
An electric equipotential surface may be described as electro-static,<br>
electro- magnetic, or magnetic; or may be an equipotential surface of a<br>
current conductor. Besides these there are mechanical and physical<br>
equipotential surfaces, such as those of gravitation.<br>

Suspension by two vertical parallel fibres, as of a galvanometer needle.<br>
The restitution force is gravity, the torsion being comparatively slight<br>
and negligible. Leaving torsion out of account the restitution force is<br>
(a) proportional to the distance between the threads;. (b) inversely<br>
proportional to their length; (c) proportional to weight of the needle<br>
or other object suspended; (d) proportional to the angle of<br>
displacement.<br>

Assume two masses A and B at the end of a weightless rod, suspended by<br>
the parallel cords a A, b B. Let the rod be rotated through an angle<br>
theta. Consider the cord a A. Its lower end is swung through the angle<br>
theta, as referred to the center O; the cord is deflected from the<br>
vertical by an angle psi, such that a A tang(psi)= O A 2 sin (theta/2).<br>
The component of gravitation tending to restore A to A, acting towards A<br>
is equal to m g tan(psi). Its moment around O is equal to (m g tan(psi))<br>
* (O A cos(theta/2). The whole moment of the couple is 2 m g&nbsp;
tan(psi).<br>
0 A. cos(theta/2) = 2 m g (O A2/ a A) 2 sin(theta/2). Cos(theta/2) =<br>
2mgl(OA2/aA) sin(theta). The moment of the restoring force is thus<br>
proportional to the sine of the angle of deflection, and the<br>
oscillations of such a system are approximately simple harmonic.<br>
(Daniell.)<br>
<br>
If the twisting is carried so far as to cause the threads to cross and<br>
come in contact with each other the suspension ceases to be a bifilar<br>
suspension, but assumes the nature of a torsional suspension.<br>

<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Switch.</span><br>
A device for opening and closing an electric circuit.<br>
<br>
A simple type is the ordinary telegrapher's switch. A bar of metal is<br>
mounted horizontally by a pivot at one end, so as to be free to rotate<br>
through an arc of a circle. In one position its free end rests upon a<br>
stud of metal. One terminal of a circuit is attached to its journal, the<br>
other to the stud. Resting on the stud it closes the circuit, in other<br>
positions it opens the circuit.<br>
<br>
<br>
500&nbsp;&nbsp; STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Switch, Automatic.</span><br>
A switch opened and closed by the electric current. It is used for<br>
lighting distant incandescent lamps. It includes one or two<br>
electro-magnets operated by two push buttons. In the usual arrangement<br>
one button is black and the other white, for extinguishing and lighting<br>
respectively. When the white button is pushed it causes a current to<br>
pass through one of the electro-magnets. This attracts its armature,<br>
thereby making a contact and throwing the lamps into the lighting<br>
circuit. Then they remain lighted until the black button is pressed.<br>
This excites the other magnet, which attracts its armature, breaks the<br>
contact and extinguishes the lights.<br>
<br>
The object of the automatic switch is to enable distant lamps to be<br>
lighted without the necessity of carrying the electric leads or wires to<br>
the place whence the lighting is to be done. A very small wire will<br>
carry enough current to operate the magnets, and open circuit batteries,<br>
such as Leclanch&eacute; batteries, may be used as the source of
current for<br>
the switch, but generally the lighting current is used for the purpose.<br>
<br>
A single magnet may do the work. When the lighting button is pressed the<br>
magnet is excited, attracts its armature and holds it attracted, until<br>
by pressing the black button the current is turned off from it. In this<br>
case the lighting current is used to excite the magnet.<br>

<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Switch, Snap.</span><br>
A switch constructed to give a quick, sharp break. It has a spiral<br>
spring interposed between the handle and arm. As the handle is drawn<br>
back to open it the spring is first extended, the bar being held by the<br>
friction of the contacts, until the spring suddenly jerks it up, thus<br>
breaking the contact.<br>
<br>
<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Tangent Law.</span><br>
In a galvanometer the tangents of the angles of deflection of the needle<br>
are proportional to the deflecting force--<br>
<br>
I.&nbsp; When the controlling force is unaltered in absolute magnitude
and<br>
direction by the motion of the needle.<br>
<br>
II. When the deflecting force acts at right angles always to the<br>
controlling force.<br>
<br>
These conditions are usually secured by having the actuating coil<br>
through which the current passes flat and of large diameter compared to<br>
the length of the needle; by using the uniform field of the earth as the<br>
control; by having a short needle; by placing the coil with its plane in<br>
the magnetic meridian.<br>

Fig. 310. GRAPHIC CONSTRUCTION OF TANGENT SCALE.<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Tangent Scale.</span><br>
An arc of a circle in which the number of graduations in any arc<br>
starting from zero are proportional to the tangent of the angle<br>
subtended by such arc. The system is for use with tangent galvanometers.<br>
Thus if for 45&deg; a value of 100 is taken and marked on the scale
then for<br>
the arc 26&deg; 33' + a value of 50 should be marked on the scale
because<br>
such are the relative values of the tangents.<br>
<br>
Thus the scale instead of being divided into degrees is divided into<br>
arcs of varying length, growing shorter as they are more distant from<br>
the zero point, of such length that the first division being subtended<br>
by a tangent of length 1, the first and second divisions added or taken<br>
together as one arc are subtended by a tangent of length 2, and so on.<br>
<br>
In the cut a simple method of graphically laying out a tangent scale is<br>
shown. In it C is the centre of the arc, and H the radius running to the<br>
zero of the instrument. From C a circle is described and on H a vertical<br>
line tangent to the arc is erected. Taking any part of the tangent, as<br>
the length shown ending at D, it is divided into any number of equal<br>
parts. Radii of the circle are now drawn whose prolongations pass<br>
through the divisions on the tangent. These radii, where they intersect<br>
the arc of the circle, determine equal divisions of the tangent scale,<br>
which, as is evident from the construction, are unequal angular<br>
divisions of the arc.<br>

It cannot be due to any measurable quantity of current or of<br>
electrolytic decomposition, because the couple can do little more than<br>
establish a potential difference. With a strong current the taste<br>
becomes too strong for comfort, and if on a telegraph line the extra<br>
currents produced by the signaling make the operation of tasting the<br>
current a very unpleasant one. It is said that messages have been<br>
received in this way, the receiver placing one terminal of the line on<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Telegraph, Automatic.</span><br>
A telegraph system based on the operation of the transmitting instrument<br>
by a perforated strip of paper drawn through it. The perforations made<br>
by an apparatus termed a perforator, are so arranged as to give<br>
telegraphic characters of the Morse or International Code in the<br>
transmitting instrument. (See Perforator.) Bain in the year 1846 was the<br>
originator of the system. He punched a fillet of paper with dots and<br>
dashes, and drew it between two terminals of the line, thus sending over<br>
the line a corresponding series of short and long currents which were<br>
received by his chemical receiver. (See Chemical Receiver.) The method<br>
was not successful. Its modern development, the Wheatstone Automatic<br>
Telegraph, is highly so. The perforated paper by its perforations<br>
controls the reciprocating movement of two rods, which pass through each<br>
hole in two rows, corresponding to the two rods respectively as the<br>
holes come opposite to the ends of the rods. The rods are kept<br>
constantly moving up and down. If unperforated paper is above them their<br>
upward motion is limited. This gives three positions for the rods, (a)<br>
both down, (b) one up and the other down, (c) both up. These positions<br>
of the rods work a pole changing key by which dots, spaces, and dashes<br>
are transmitted to the receiving instrument, which is an exceedingly<br>
delicate ink-printer. The latter can have its speed adjusted to receive<br>
from 200 to 450 words per minute.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Telegraph, Dial.</span><br>
A telegraph in which as receiver a dial instrument is used. A pointer or<br>
index hand moves around a dial. The dial is marked with letters of the<br>
alphabet. The movements of the pointer are controlled by the<br>
transmitting operator at a distant station. He by the same actions moves<br>
a pointer on a duplicate instrument before him and the two are<br>
synchronized to give identical indications. Thus a message is spelled<br>
out letter by letter on both dials simultaneously. The motions of the<br>
index are generally produced by what is virtually a recoil escapement.<br>
The scape wheel is carried by the axle of the index, and a pallet or<br>
anchor is vibrated by an electro-magnet whose armature is attached to<br>
the stem of the pallet. As the pallet is vibrated it turns the wheel and<br>
index one tooth for each single movement. There are as many teeth in the<br>
wheel as there are characters on the dial. The two instruments being in<br>
duplicate and synchronized, the pallets move exactly in unison, so that<br>
identical readings of the dials are given. The pallets may be moved by<br>
any kind of make and break mechanism, such as an ordinary telegraph key.<br>
The index moves by steps or jerks, so that the system is sometimes<br>
called step-by-step telegraphy.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Telegraph, Duplex.</span><br>
A telegraph capable of transmitting simultaneously two messages over one<br>
wire. The methods of effecting it are distinct from those of multiplex<br>
telegraphy. This term is used as a distinction from diode multiplex<br>
telegraphy, in which the work is done on other principles. There are two<br>
systems of duplex telegraphy, the differential and the bridge systems.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Telegraph, Duplex Bridge.</span><br>
A system of duplex telegraphy employing the principle of the Wheatstone<br>
bridge. The other or differential system depends on equality or<br>
difference of currents; the bridge method on equality or difference of<br>
potentials. The cut shows the system known as Steam's Plan.<br>
<br>
At the ends of the line wire are two cross connections like duplicate<br>
galvanometer connections in a Wheatstone bridge, each including a<br>
receiving relay. The rest of the connections are self-explanatory.<br>
<br>
When A depresses his key the current splits at the point indicating the<br>
beginning of the bridge. One portion goes through the line to B and to<br>
earth, the other goes to earth at A through the rheostats indicated by<br>
the corrugated lines.<br>
<br>
On reaching B's end the current divides at the cross-connection and part<br>
goes through the receiving relay shown in the center of that<br>
cross-connection.<br>
<br>
Thus if A sends to B or B to A it is without effect on the home<br>
receiving instrument. Now suppose that both simultaneously are sending<br>
in opposite directions. If the connections be studied it will be seen<br>
that every movement of the transmitting key will affect the balance of<br>
the distant or receiving end of the bridge and so its instrument will<br>
record the signals as they are sent.<br>
<br>
As shown in the cut the sending keys are on local circuits, and work<br>
what are known as duplex transmitters. These are instruments which send<br>
line signals without breaking the connection.<br>

<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Telegraph, Duplex, Differential.</span><br>
A system of duplex telegraphy employing the differential action of two<br>
exciting or magnetizing coils. The general principles are the following.<br>
Suppose that at each of two stations, there is a magnet working as a<br>
sounder or relay. Each magnet is differentially wound, with two coils of<br>
opposite direction, of identical number of turns.<br>
<br>
When the sending key at a station A is depressed two exactly equal<br>
currents go through the magnet in opposite directions. One called the<br>
compensation current goes to the earth at the stations. The other called<br>
the line current goes through the line, through the line coil of the<br>
distant station E, thereby actuating the relay or sounder armature.<br>
<br>
The instrument of the sender A is unaffected because he is sending<br>
opposite and equal currents through its two coils. A special resistance<br>
is provided on the compensation circuit for keeping the currents exactly<br>
equal in effect. Nothing the sender at A does affects his own<br>
instrument.<br>
<br>
Now suppose E desires to telegraph back at the same time that A is<br>
telegraphing to his station. He works his key. This does not affect his<br>
own instrument except by sending the equal and opposite currents through<br>
its coils. When his key is depressed and A's key is untouched, he works<br>
A's receiving instrument.<br>
<br>
<br>
508&nbsp;&nbsp; STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.<br>
<br>
<br>
When A's key is depressed simultaneously with B's key, the two line<br>
currents are in opposition and neutralize each other. This throws out<br>
the balance in the instruments and both armatures are attracted by the<br>
compensation currents left free to act by the neutralization of the line<br>
currents.<br>
<br>
<br>

Fig. 314. DUPLEX TELEGRAPH, DIFFERENTIAL SYSTEM<br>
<br>
<br>
Suppose that B is sending a dash, and it begins while A's key is raised.<br>
The line and compensation currents in B's receiving instrument<br>
neutralize each other and no effect is produced, while A's receiving<br>
instrument begins to register or indicate a dash. Now suppose A starts<br>
to send a dash while B's is half over. He depresses his key. This sends<br>
the two opposite currents through his magnet. His line current<br>
neutralizes B's working current so that the compensation currents in<br>
both receiving instruments hold the armatures attracted for the two<br>
dashes. Meanwhile A's dash ends and he releases his key. At once his<br>
line current ceases to neutralize B's line current, his receiving<br>
instrument is actuated now by B's line current, while B's receiving<br>
instrument ceases to be actuated by the compensation current.<br>
<br>
Two assumptions are made in the above description. The line currents are<br>
assumed to be equal in strength and opposite in direction at each<br>
station. Neither of these is necessary. The line current received at a<br>
station is always weaker than the outgoing line current, and it is the<br>
preponderance of the compensation current over the partly neutralized<br>
line current that does the work. As this preponderance is very nearly<br>
equal to the line current received from the distant station, the signals<br>
are actuated by almost the same current, whether it is compensation or<br>
line current.<br>
<br>
<br>
509&nbsp;&nbsp; STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.<br>
<br>
<br>
Both line currents may coincide in direction. Then when the two keys are<br>
depressed, a line current of double strength goes through both receiving<br>
instruments and both work by preponderance of the double line current<br>
over the compensation current. In other respects the operation is the<br>
same as before described.<br>

<br>
The cut shows a diagram of the operation of one end of the line. R and R<br>
are resistances, E and E are earth contacts, and the two circles show<br>
the magnet of the receiving instrument wound with two coils in<br>
opposition. The battery and key are also shown. It also illustrates what<br>
happens if the key of the receiver is in the intermediate position<br>
breaking contact at both 1 and 2. The sender's line current then goes<br>
through both coils of the receiving instrument magnet, but this time in<br>
series, and in coincident direction. This actuates the instrument as<br>
before. Owing to the resistance only half the normal current passes, but<br>
this half goes through twice as many coils or turns as if the receiver's<br>
key was in either of the other two positions.<br>
<br>
In actual practice there are many refinements. To compensate for the<br>
varying resistance of the line a rheostat or resistance with sliding<br>
connection arm is connected in the compensation circuit so that the<br>
resistance can be instantly changed. As the electro-static capacity of<br>
the line varies sectional condensers are also connected in the<br>
compensation circuits.<br>

<br>
On the transmitter the design is drawn with non-conducting ink. A tracer<br>
presses upon the surface of each cylinder and a circuit is completed<br>
through the two contacts. In operation a sheet of chemically prepared<br>
paper is placed over the surface of the receiving cylinder. The two<br>
cylinders are rotated in exact synchronism and the tracers are traversed<br>
longitudinally as the cylinders rotate. Thus a number of makes and<br>
breaks are produced by the transmitting cylinder, and on the receiving<br>
cylinder the chemicals in the paper are decomposed, producing marks on<br>
the paper exactly corresponding to those on the transmitting cylinder.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Telegraph, Harmonic Multiplex.</span><br>
A telegraph utilizing sympathetic vibration for the transmission of<br>
several messages at once over the same line. It is the invention of<br>
Elisha Gray. The transmitting instrument comprises a series of vibrating<br>
reeds or tuning-forks, each one of a different note, kept in vibration<br>
each by its own electro-magnet. Each fork is in its own circuit, and all<br>
unite with the main line so as to send over it a make and break current<br>
containing as many notes superimposed as there are tuning forks. At the<br>
other end of the line there are corresponding tuning forks, each with<br>
its own magnet. Each fork at this end picks up its own note from the<br>
makes and breaks on the main line, by the principle of sympathetic<br>
vibration.<br>
<br>
To each pair of operators a pair of forks of identical notes are<br>
assigned. As many messages can be transmitted simultaneously as there<br>
are pairs of forks or reeds.<br>
<br>
The movements of a telegraph key in circuit with one of the transmitting<br>
reeds sends signals of the Morse alphabet, which are picked out by the<br>

A printing telegraph in very extensive use in continental Europe. Its<br>
general features are as follows:<br>
<br>
The instruments at each end of the line are identical. Each includes a<br>
keyboard like a piano manual, with a key for each letter or character.<br>
On each machine is a type wheel, which has the characters engraved in<br>
relief upon its face. With the wheel a "chariot" as it is termed also<br>
rotates. The type wheels at both stations are synchronized. When a key<br>
is depressed, a pin is thrown up which arrests the chariot, and sends a<br>
current to the distant station. This current causes a riband of paper to<br>
be pressed up against the face of both type wheels so as to receive the<br>
imprint of the character corresponding to the key. The faces of the<br>
wheels are inked by an inking roller.<br>
<br>
<br>
Fig. 317. ELECTRO-MAGNET OF HUGHES' PRINTING TELEGRAPH.<br>

<br>
The most characteristic feature is the fact that the current sent by<br>
depressing a key does not attract an armature, but releases one, which<br>
is then pulled back by a spring. The armature is restored to its<br>
position by the mechanical operation of the instrument. The magnet used<br>
is a polarized electro-magnet. Coils are carried on the ends of a strong<br>
powerful magnet. The coils are so connected that a current sent through<br>
them by depressing a key is in opposition to the magnetism of the<br>
permanent magnet so that it tends to release the armature, and in<br>
practice does so. This release permits the printing mechanism to act.<br>
The latter is driven by a descending weight, so that very slight<br>
electric currents can actuate the instruments.<br>

by a telegraph key, which when depressed closes the circuit, and when<br>

system are the use of the dot and dash alphabet, and the use of the<br>
local circuit, which circuit includes a receiving instrument, and is<br>
worked by a relay, actuating a local battery. It would be difficult to<br>

In the United States the simplest disposition of apparatus is generally<br>
used. The main line is kept on closed circuit. In it may be included a<br>
large number of relays at stations all along the line, each with its own<br>
local circuit. There may be fifty of such stations. Battery is generally<br>
placed at each end of the line. Very generally gravity batteries are<br>
used, although dynamos now tend to supplant them in important stations.<br>
<br>
As relays the ordinary relay is used. Its local circuit includes a<br>
sounder and local battery. The latter is very generally of the gravity<br>
type, but oxide of copper batteries (See Battery, Oxide of Copper) are<br>
now being introduced. At main or central offices, the terminals of the<br>
lines reach switch boards, where by spring-jacks and plugs, any desired<br>
circuits can be looped into the main circuit in series therewith.<br>
<br>
In European practise the main line is kept on open circuit. Polarized<br>
relays are used to work the local circuits. The currents for these have<br>
to be alternating in direction. When the line is not in use its ends are<br>
connected to earth at both ends, leaving the battery out of circuit.<br>
Each intermediate station has its own main, or line battery for use when<br>
it desires to send a message. In the American system as first described,<br>
it will be seen that the main batteries are at most two in number.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Telegraph, Multiplex.</span><br>
A system of telegraphy by which a number of messages can be transmitted<br>
in both directions over a single wire. The principles underlying the<br>
systems are the following:<br>
<br>
Suppose that at the two extremities of a telegraph line two arms are<br>
kept in absolute synchronous rotation. Let the arms in their rotation,<br>
press upon as many conducting segments as there are to be transmissions<br>
over the line. A transmitting and receiving set of instruments may be<br>
connected to one segment at one end of the line, and another set to the<br>
corresponding segment at the distant station. For each pair of segments<br>
two sets can be thus connected. Then if the arm rotates so rapidly that<br>
the contacts succeed each other rapidly enough each pair of sets of<br>
instruments can be worked independently of the others. In practice this<br>
rapid succession is effected by having a number of contacts made for<br>
each pair during a single rotation of the arm or equivalent.<br>
<br>
The multiplex system has been perfected by the use of La Cour's phonic<br>
wheel (see Phonic Wheel), and brought into a practical success by<br>
Patrick B. Delany, of New York.<br>
<br>
Two phonic wheels rotate at each end of the line. They are kept in<br>
synchronous motion by two vibrating steel reeds of exactly the same<br>
fundamental note, and the axle of each wheel carries an arm whose end<br>
trails over the contacts or distributor segments already spoken of. The<br>
reeds are adjusted to vibrate at such speed that the trailer is in<br>
contact with each segment about 1/500 second. The number of groups of<br>
segments required for each working is determined by the retardation of<br>
the signals owing to the static capacity of the line. To convert the<br>
rapidly recurring impulses of current into practically a single current,<br>
condensers are connected across the coils of the relay. One battery<br>
serves for all the arms.<br>
<br>
Multiplex telegraphy can effect from two to six simultaneous<br>
transmissions over one wire. For two or four transmissions the method<br>
only distinguishes it from duplex or quadruplex telegraphy. The terms<br>
diode, triode, tetrode, pentode and hexode working are used to indicate<br>
respectively the simultaneous transmission of two, three, four, five, or<br>
six messages over one wire.<br>
<br>
It will be seen that the multiplex process really assigns to each<br>
transmission separate times, but divides these times into such short and<br>
quickly recurring intervals that the work is executed as if there was<br>
continuous contact. In no case is there the popular conception of the<br>
sending of several messages actually simultaneously over one wire. Each<br>
signal in reality has its own time assigned it, divided into short<br>
periods of high frequency, and only utilizes the line when it is free.<br>

An English term for telegraph lines led over houses and supported on<br>

<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Telegraph Pole Brackets.</span><br>
Arms for carrying insulators, which arms are attached to telegraph poles<br>
or other support. They vary in style; sometimes they are straight bars<br>

<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Telegraph, Printing.</span><br>
Various telegraphs have been invented for printing in the ordinary<br>
alphabet the messages at the receiving end of the line.<br>
<br>
Representative instruments of this class are used for transmitting<br>
different market and stock reports to business offices from the<br>
exchanges. The type faces are carried on the periphery of a printing<br>
wheel, which is rotated like the hand of a dial telegraph, and against<br>
whose face a paper riband is pressed whenever the proper letter comes<br>
opposite to it. As each letter is printed the paper moves forward the<br>
space of one letter. Spacing between words is also provided for. In the<br>
recent instruments two lines of letters are printed on the paper one<br>
above the other.<br>
<br>
In England, and on the continent of Europe, printing instruments have<br>
received considerable use for ordinary telegraphic work. Hughes' type<br>
printer and Wheatstone's ABC telegraph meet with extensive use there for<br>
ordinary transmission.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Telegraph, Quadruplex.</span><br>
Duplex telegraphy is the sending of two messages in opposite directions<br>
simultaneously through the same wire. Duplex telegraphy is the sending<br>
of two messages simultaneously in the same direction. The two combined<br>
constitute quadruplex telegraphy. [SIC]<br>
<br>
The system was suggested by Stark of Vienna and Bosscha of Leyden in<br>
1855; the successful problem was solved by Edison in 1874.<br>
<br>
The principle is based on the two orders of difference in electric<br>
currents; they may vary in strength or in direction. Thus we may have<br>
one instrument which works with change of strength of current only, the<br>
other with change of direction only. The two can be worked together if<br>
the direction of the current can be altered without alteration of<br>
strength, and if strength can be altered without alteration of<br>
direction. Double current and single current working are so combined<br>
that one relay works by one system of currents and another relay by the<br>
other system. A current is constantly maintained through the line. The<br>
relay operated by change in direction is a simple polarized relay which<br>
works by change of direction of current. The relay operated by change in<br>
strength is the ordinary unpolarized relay.<br>

For the following description and the cuts illustrating it we are<br>

apparatus and connections for terminal offices.<br>

"Sufficient table room is provided to seat four clerks. The apparatus is<br>
arranged for the two senders to sit together in the centre, the messages<br>
to be forwarded being placed between them. The section on the left of<br>
the switch Q is known as the 'A' side, that on the right as the 'B' side<br>
of the apparatus.<br>
<br>
K1 the reversing key, reverses the direction of the current. K2 is a<br>
simple key, known as the increment key; it is used simply to increase<br>
the strength of the current.<br>

Fig. 320. QUADRUPLEX TELEGRAPH CONNECTIONS.<br>
<br>
<br>
The way in which the keys K1 and K2 combine their action is shown by<br>
Fig. 321. E1 and E2 are the line batteries, the one having two and<br>
one-third (2-1/3) the number of cells of the other, so that if E1 be the<br>
electro-motive force of the smaller, that of the whole combined battery<br>
will be 3.3 E1. The negative pole of E1 is connected to z and z1
of&nbsp; K1<br>
and the positive pole of E2 to a of K2 through a resistance coil s. A<br>
wire, called the 'tap' wire, connects the positive pole of E1 and the<br>
negative pole of E2 to b of K2. This wire has in it a resistance coil<br>
r2. The springs c and c1 of Kl are connected to the lever L of K2. Now,<br>
when both keys are at rest, the negative pole of E1 is to line through<br>
z, and the positive pole of E1 to earth through b of K2 and c of K1; the<br>
positive pole of E2 being insulated at a of K2.<br>
<br>
<br>
517&nbsp;&nbsp; STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.<br>
<br>
<br>
There is thus a weak negative current flowing to line. When K1 alone is<br>
worked, the current of E1 is reversed. When K2 is worked alone, c of K1<br>
is transferred from b to a, and the strength of the negative current<br>
going to line is increased through the increase of the electro-motive<br>
force from E1 to 3.3 E1 for the whole battery is brought into play. When<br>
K1 and K2 are depressed together, then the negative pole of E1 goes to<br>
earth through Z1; and the positive pole of E2 to line through a of K2<br>
and c1 of K1 and a positive current, due to the whole electro-motive<br>
force 3.3 E1 goes to line. Hence the effect of working K1 is simply to<br>
reverse the current, whatever its strength, while that of K2 is to<br>
strengthen it, whatever its direction.<br>
<br>
The resistance coil s, of 100&deg; resistance, is called a spark coil,<br>
because it prevents the high electro-motive force of the whole battery<br>
from damaging the points of contact by sparking or forming an arc across<br>
when signals are sent; and the resistance r2 is made approximately equal<br>
to the combined resistance of E2 and the spark coil, so that the total<br>
resistance of the circuit may not be altered by the working of the<br>
apparatus.<br>

A1 and B1 (Fig. 320) are the relays which are used to respond to the<br>
changes in the currents sent by the keys K1 and K2 at the distant<br>
station.<br>
<br>
A, is a simple polarized relay wound differentially, each wire having a<br>
resistance of 200 [omega], and so connected up as to respond to the
working of<br>
the reversing key K1 of the distant station. It acts independently of<br>
the strength of the current, and is therefore not affected by the<br>
working of the increment key K2. It is connected up so as to complete<br>
the local circuit of the sounder S1 and the local battery l1 and forms<br>
the receiving portion of the 'A' side.<br>
<br>
B, is a non-polarized relay also wound differentially, each coil having
<br>
a resistance of 200 [omega]. It responds only to an increase in the <br>
strength of the current, and therefore only to the working of the <br>
increment key K2 of the distant station.<br>

<br>
The relay spring is so adjusted that the armatures are not actuated by<br>
the weak current sent from E by the key K1.<br>
<br>
In its normal position this relay completes the circuit of the local<br>
battery through the sounder S. This sounder S, called the uprighting<br>
sounder, acts as a relay to a second sounder, S2, called the reading<br>
sounder, which is worked by another local battery, l2. Of course,<br>
normally, the armature of S is held down and that of S2 is up, but when<br>
the tongue t moves, as it does when the increment key K2 is depressed so<br>
as to send the whole current to line, then the current from l is<br>
interrupted, and the circuit of l2 is completed by the rising of the<br>
armature of S, causing the reading sounder S2 to work. This is the 'B'<br>
side.<br>
<br>
R is a rheostat for balancing the resistance of the line, as used in<br>
duplex working.<br>
<br>
C is a condenser used for compensating the static charge of the line. It<br>
is provided with an adjustable retardation coil, R1, to prolong the<br>
effect of the compensating current from the condenser.<br>
<br>
G is a differential galvanometer, used for testing, and for facilitating<br>
adjustment and balancing.<br>
<br>
Q is a switch for putting the line to earth, either for balancing, or<br>
for any other purpose. There is on the earth wire leading from Q a<br>
resistance coil, r1, equalling approximately the resistance of the whole<br>
battery, 3.3 E1, and the resistance s.<br>
<br>
The connections shown in Fig. 321, are for an 'up' office. At a 'down'<br>
office it is necessary to reverse the wires on the two lower terminals<br>
of the galvanometer and the two battery wires on the reversing key K1.<br>
<br>
The keys K1 and K2 are, for repeaters, replaced by transmitters.<br>
<br>
The adjustment of this apparatus requires great care and great accuracy.<br>
Its good working depends essentially on technical skill that can only be<br>
acquired by patience and perseverance.<br>
<br>
Faults in working generally arise from careless adjustments, dirty<br>
contacts, loose connections, battery failures, and the ordinary line<br>
interruptions, but there are no troubles that are beyond the reach of<br>
ordinary skill, and it can be safely said that, within moderate<br>
distances, wherever and whenever duplex working is practicable, then<br>
quadruplex working is so too."<br>
<br>
The above is a typical quadruplex bridge system. There is also a<br>
differential system, the full description of which, in addition to what<br>
has been given, is outside of the scope of this work.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Telegraph Repeater.</span><br>
An extension of the relay system, adopted for long lines. A repeating<br>
station comprises in general terms duplicate repeating apparatus. One<br>
set is connected for messages in one direction, the other for messages<br>
in the opposite direction. The general operation of a repeating set is<br>
as follows. The signals as received actuate a relay which by its local<br>
circuit actuates a key, which in ordinary practise would be the sounder,<br>
but in the repeater its lever opens and closes a circuit comprising a<br>
battery and a further section of the line.<br>
<br>
Repeaters are placed at intervals along the line. Each repeater repeats<br>
the signals received for the next section of line with a new battery. It<br>
represents an operator who would receive and repeat the message, except<br>
that it works automatically.<br>
<br>
The Indo-European line from London to Teheran, 3,800 miles long, is<br>
worked directly without any hand retransmission, it being carried out by<br>
five repeaters. This gives an average of over 500 miles for each<br>
repeater.<br>
[Transcriber's note: &#8230; 650 miles for each repeater.]<br>
<br>
Repeaters introduce retardation, and each repeater involves a reduction<br>
in the rate of working. Yet in many cases they increase the speed of a<br>
line greatly, as its speed is about equal to that of its worst section,<br>
which may be far greater than that of the whole line in one.<br>

A telegraph system in which the code is transmitted by the movements of<br>
a needle shaped index which oscillates to right and left, the left hand<br>
deflection corresponding to dots, the right hand deflection to dashes.<br>
The instruments for sending and receiving are combined into one. The<br>
needles are virtually the indexes of vertical galvanometers. In one form<br>
by a tapper key (see Tapper), in another form by a key worked by a<br>
drop-handle (the drop handle instrument), currents of opposite<br>
directions are sent down the line. These pass through both instruments,<br>
affecting both needles and causing them to swing to right or left, as<br>
the operator moves his key.<br>
<br>
As galvanometer needle or actuating needle a soft iron needle is<br>
employed, which is polarized by the proximity of two permanent magnets.<br>
This avoids danger of reversal of polarity from lightning, a trouble<br>
incident to the old system.<br>

C and Z are two strips of metal to which the positive and negative poles<br>
of the battery are respectively connected. E and L are two metallic<br>
springs; E is connected to earth, L is connected to the line; at rest<br>
both press against Z. If L is depressed so as to touch C, the current<br>
from the battery goes to the line by the key L, goes through the coils<br>
of the distant instrument and deflects the needle to one side, and then<br>
goes to the earth. If the key E is depressed, L retaining its normal<br>
position, the direction of the current is reversed, for the other pole<br>
of the battery is connected to the earth and the reverse current going<br>
through the coils of the distant instrument deflects the galvanometer<br>
needle to the other side.<br>

A magneto-electric telegraph of the dial system. An alternating current<br>

message is received by a dial instrument working by the escapement<br>
motion described under Telegraph, Dial.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Telegraph, Writing.</span><br>
A telegraph in which the message is received in written characters. The<br>
transmitter includes a stylus which is held in the hand and whose point<br>
bears against the upper end of a vertical rod. The rod is susceptible of<br>
oscillation in all directions, having at its base a spring support<br>
equivalent to a universal joint.<br>
<br>
The stylus is moved about in the shape of letters. As it does this it<br>
throws a series of resistances in and out of the circuit.<br>
<br>
At the receiving end of the line the instrument for recording the<br>
message includes two electro-magnets with their cores at right angles to<br>
each other and their faces near together at the point of the angle. An<br>
armature is supported between the faces and through it a vertical rod<br>
carried by a spring at its bottom rises. These magnets receive current<br>
proportional to the resistances cut in and out by the motions of the<br>
other rod at the transmitting end of the line. These resistances are<br>
arranged in two series at right angles to each other, one for each<br>
magnet. Thus the movements of the transmitting stylus and rod are<br>
repeated by the end of the rod in the receiving instrument. A species of<br>
pen is carried at the end of the rod of the receiving instrument, which<br>
marks the letters upon a riband of paper which is fed beneath it.<br>

traversed by a selenium resistance through which the current passes.<br>
This is moved systematically over its entire area, thus constituting the<br>
transmitter, and synchronously with the motion of the selenium a contact<br>
point at the other end of the line moves systematically over a sheet of<br>
chemically prepared paper. The paper, which may be saturated with a<br>
solution of potassium ferrocyanide and ammonium nitrate, is stained by<br>
the passage of the current, and by the variation in intensity of<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Telepherage.</span><br>
An electric transportation system, hitherto only used for the carrying<br>
of ore, freight, etc. Its characteristic feature is that the electric<br>
conductors, suspended from poles, supply the way on which carriages<br>
provided with electric motors run. The motors take their current<br>
directly from the conductors.<br>
<br>
There are two conducting lines, running parallel with each other,<br>
supported at the opposite ends of transverse brackets on a row of<br>
supporting poles. At each pole the lines cross over so that right line<br>
alternates with left, between consecutive pairs of poles.<br>
<br>
The cars are suspended from pulleys running on one or the other of the<br>
conductors. A train of such cars are connected and the current is taken<br>
in near one end and leaves near the other end of the train. These<br>
current connections are so distant, their distance being regulated by<br>
the length of the train, that they are, for all but an instant at the<br>
time of passing each of the poles, in connection with segments of the<br>
line which are of opposite potential. To carry out this principle the<br>
distance between contacts is equal to the distance between poles. Owing<br>
to the crossing over of the lines the contacts are in connection as<br>
described and thereby the actuating current is caused to go through the<br>
motors.<br>
<br>
Cars running in one direction go on the electric conductors on the one<br>
side, those running in the other direction go on the other conductor.<br>

A great many refinements have been introduced, but the system has been<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Telephone.</span><br>
An instrument for the transmission of articulate speech by the electric<br>

<br>
The cut shows what may be termed the fundamental telephone circuit. A<br>
line wire is shown terminating in ground plates and with a telephone in<br>
circuit at each end. The latter consists of a magnet N S with a coil of<br>
insulated wire H surrounding one end. Facing the pole of the magnet is a<br>
soft iron diaphragm D, held in a frame or mouthpiece T. Any change of<br>
current in the line affects the magnetism of the magnet, causing it to<br>
attract the diaphragm more or less. The magnet and diaphragm really<br>
constitute a little electric motor, the diaphragm vibrating back and<br>
forth through an exceedingly short range, for changes in the magnetic<br>
attraction.<br>
<br>
The principle of the reversibility of the dynamo applies here. If the<br>
magnet is subjected to no change in magnetism, and if the diaphragm is<br>
moved or vibrated in front of its poles, currents will be induced in the<br>
wire bobbin which surrounds its end. If two such magnets with bobbins<br>
and diaphragms are arranged as shown, vibrations imparted to one<br>
diaphragm will send currents through the line which, affecting the<br>
magnetism of the distant magnet, will cause its diaphragm to vibrate in<br>
exact accordance with the motions of the first or motor diaphragm. In<br>
the combination one telephone represents a dynamo, the other a motor.<br>
<br>
If the vibrations of the diaphragm are imparted by the voice, the voice<br>
with all its modulations will be reproduced by the telephone at the<br>
distant end of the line.<br>

The above gives the essential features of the Bell telephone. In<br>
practice the telephone is used only as the receiver. As transmitter a<br>
microphone is employed. To give the current a battery, generally of the<br>
open circuit type, is used, and the current in the line is an induced or<br>
secondary one.<br>
<br>
The microphone which is talked to, and which is the seat of the current<br>
variations which reproduce original sound, is termed the transmitter,<br>
the telephone in which the sounds are produced at the distant end of the<br>
line is termed the receiver.<br>
<br>
Fig. 325 shows the construction of the Bell telephone in universal use<br>
in this country as the receiver. M is a bar magnet, in a case L L. B B<br>
is a bobbin or coil of insulated wire surrounding one end of the magnet.<br>
D is the diaphragm of soft iron plate (ferrotype metal), and E is the<br>
mouthpiece. The terminals of the coil B B connect with the binding<br>
screws C C. The wire in the coil is No. 36, A. W. G., and is wound to a<br>
resistance of about 80 ohms.<br>

<br>
As typical transmitter the Blake instrument may be cited. It is a carbon<br>
microphone. It is shown in section in the cut; a is the mouthpiece and e<br>
is a diaphragm of iron plate, although other substances could be used; f<br>
is a steel spring, with a platinum contact piece at its end. One end<br>
bears against the diaphragm, the other against a carbon block k. The<br>
latter is carried by a brass block p, and pressure is maintained between<br>
these contacts by the spring g and weight of the piece c, which by<br>
gravity tends to press all together. The current passes by way of the<br>
spring f, carbon button k and spring g through the circuit indicated.<br>
<br>
A battery is in circuit with these parts. If a telephone is also in<br>
circuit, and the transmitter is spoken against, the diaphragm vibrating<br>
affects the resistance of the carbon-platinum contact, without even<br>
breaking the contact, and the telephone reproduces the sound. The heavy<br>
piece of metal C acts by its inertia to prevent breaking of the contact.<br>
The position of this piece c, which is carried by the brass plate m, is<br>
adjusted by the screw n.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Telephone, Capillary.</span><br>
A telephone utilizing electro-capillarity for the production of<br>
telephonic effects. The following describes the invention of Antoine<br>
Breguet.<br>
<br>
The point of a glass tube, drawn out at its lower end to a capillary<br>
opening dips vertically into a vessel. This vessel is partly filled with<br>
mercury, over which is a layer of dilute sulphuric acid. The end of the<br>
immersed tube dips into the acid, but does not reach the mercury. One<br>
line contact is with mercury in the tube, the other with the mercury in<br>
the vessel. The arrangement of tube and vessel is duplicated, giving one<br>
set for each end of the line. On introducing a battery in the circuit<br>
the level of the mercury is affected by electro-capillarity. The tubes<br>
are closed by plates or diaphragms at their tops, so as to enclose a<br>
column of air. It is evident that the pressure of this air will depend<br>
upon the level of the mercury in the tube, and this depends on the<br>
electro-motive force. On speaking against the diaphragm the sound waves<br>
affect the air pressure, and consequently the level, enough to cause<br>
potential differences which reproduce the sound in the other instrument.<br>

heats it, thereby tempering it. For wire the process can be made<br>
continuous. The wire is fed from one roll to another, and if required<br>
one roll may be immersed in a liquid bath or the wire between the rolls<br>
may be led therein. The current is brought to one roll and goes through<br>
the wire to the other. As it does this the wire is constantly fed from<br>
one roll to another. The bath may be used as described to cool it after<br>
the heating. The amount of heating may be regulated by the rate of<br>
motion of the wire.<br>

<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Ten, Powers of.</span><br>
This adjunct to calculations has become almost indispensable in working<br>
with units of the C. G. S. system. It consists in using some power of 10<br>
as a multiplier which may be called the factor. The number multiplied<br>
may be called the characteristic. The following are the general<br>
principles.<br>
<br>
The power of 10 is shown by an exponent which indicates the number of<br>
ciphers in the multiplier. Thus 10^2 indicates 100; 10^3 indicates 1,000<br>
and so on.<br>
<br>
The exponent, if positive, denotes an integral number, as shown in the<br>
preceding paragraph. The exponent, if negative, denotes the reciprocal<br>
of the indicated power of 10. Thus 10^-2 indicates 1/100; 10^-3
indicates<br>
1/1000 and so on.<br>
<br>
The compound numbers based on these are reduced by multiplication or<br>
division to simple expressions. Thus: 3.14 X 10^7 = 3.14 X 10,000,000 =<br>
31,400,000. 3.14 X 10^-7 = 3.14/10,000,000 or 314/1000000000. Regard
must<br>
be paid to the decimal point as is done here.<br>
<br>
To add two or more expressions in this notation if the exponents of the<br>
factors are alike in all respects, add the characteristics and preserve<br>
the same factor. Thus:<br>
<br>
&nbsp; (51X 10^6) + (54 X 10^6) = 105 X 10^6.<br>
&nbsp; (9.1 X 10^-9) + (8.7 X 10^-9) = 17.8 X 10^-9.<br>
<br>
To subtract one such expression from another, subtract the<br>
characteristics and preserve the same factor. Thus:<br>
<br>
&nbsp; (54 X 10^6) - (51 X 10^6) = 3 X 10^6.<br>
<br>
If the factors have different exponents of the same sign the factor or<br>
factors of larger exponent must be reduced to the smaller exponent, by<br>
factoring. The characteristic of the expression thus treated is<br>
multiplied by the odd factor. This gives a new expression whose<br>
characteristic is added to the other, and the factor of smaller exponent<br>
is preserved for both,<br>
<br>
Thus:<br>
&nbsp; (5 X 10^7) + (5 X10^9) = (5 X 10^7) + (5 X 100 X 10^7) = 505 X
10^7.<br>
<br>
The same applies to subtraction. Thus:<br>
&nbsp; (5 X 10^9) - (5 X 10^7) = (5 X 100 X 10^7) - (5 X 10^7) = 495 X
10^7.<br>
<br>
If the factors differ in sign, it is generally best to leave the<br>
addition or subtraction to be simply expressed. However, by following<br>
the above rule, it can be done. Thus:<br>
<br>
Add<br>
&nbsp; 5 X 10^-2 and 5 X 10^3.<br>
&nbsp; 5 X 10^3 = 5 X 10^5 X 10^-2<br>
&nbsp; (5 X 10^5 X 10^-2) + (5 X 10^-2) = 500005 X 10^-2<br>
<br>
This may be reduced to a fraction 500000/100 = 5000.05.<br>
<br>
To multiply add the exponents of the factors, for the new factor, and<br>
multiply the characteristics for a new characteristic. The exponents<br>
must be added algebraically; that is, if of different signs the<br>
numerically smaller one is subtracted from the other one, and its sign<br>
is given the new exponent.<br>
<br>
Thus;<br>
&nbsp; (25 X 10^6) X (9 X 10^8) = 225 X 10^14.<br>
&nbsp; (29 X 10^ -8) X (11 X 10^7) = 319 X 10^-1<br>
&nbsp; (9 X 10^8) X (98 X 10^2) = 882 X 10^1<br>
<br>
<br>
529 &nbsp;&nbsp; STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY. <br>
<br>
<br>
To divide, subtract (algebraically) the exponent of the divisor from <br>
that of the dividend for the exponent of the new factor, and divide the
<br>
characteristics one by the other for the new characteristic. Algebraic <br>
subtraction is effected by changing the sign of the subtrahend, <br>
subtracting the numerically smaller number from the larger, and giving <br>
the result the sign of the larger number.<br>
(Thus to subtract 7 from 5 proceed thus; 5 - 7 = -2.)<br>
<br>
Thus;<br>
&nbsp; (25 X 10^6) / (5 X 10^8) = 5 X 10^-2<br>
&nbsp; (28 X 10^-8) / (5 X 10^3) = 5.6 X 10^-11<br>
<br>
[Transcriber's note: I have replaced ordinary exponential notation by<br>
the more compact and simpler "programming" representation. The last two<br>
example would be:<br>
&nbsp; 25E6 / 5E8&nbsp; = 5E-2<br>
&nbsp; 28E-8 / 5E3 = 5.6E-11<br>

The thermo-electric relations of two conductors vary at different<br>
temperatures. Sometimes at a definite point they have no electro-motive<br>
force and after passing this point the positive plate becomes a negative<br>
one and vice versa. This is inversion, or reversal. (See Thermo-electric<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Thermo-electricity.</span><br>
Electric energy, electro-motive force or electrification produced from<br>
heat energy by direct conversion. It is generally produced in a circuit<br>
composed of two electric conductors of unlike material, which circuit<br>
must possess at least two junctions of the unlike substances. By heating<br>
one of these to a higher temperature than that of the other, or by<br>
maintaining one junction at a different temperature from that of the<br>
other a potential difference is created accompanied by an electric<br>
current.<br>
<br>
In many cases differential application of heat to an identical material<br>
will develop potential difference. This effect, the converse of the<br>
Thomson effect, is not used to produce currents, as in a closed circuit<br>
the potential differences due to differential heating would neutralize<br>
each other.<br>

<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Thermo-electric Power.</span><br>
The coefficient which, multiplying the difference of temperature of the<br>
ends of a thermo-electric couple, gives the potential difference,<br>
expressed in micro-volts. It has always to be assigned to a mean or<br>
average temperature of the junctions, because the potential difference<br>
due to a fixed difference of temperature between two metals varies with<br>
the average temperature of the two junctions. (See Thermo-electric<br>
Diagram.)<br>
<br>
For bismuth and antimony at 19.5&deg; C. (67.1&deg; F.) it is 103
microvolts per<br>
degree Centigrade (1.8&deg; F.). This means that if one junction is
heated<br>
to 19&deg; C. and the other to 20&deg; C. (66.2&deg; F. and 68.0&deg;
F.) a potential<br>
difference of 103 micro-volts will be produced.<br>
<br>
The potential difference is approximately proportional to the difference<br>
of temperature of the two junctions if such difference is small. Hence<br>
for large differences of potential the thermo-electric power coefficient<br>
does not apply.<br>
<br>
As a differential function it is thus deduced by Sir William Thomson,<br>
for expressing the E. M. F. in a thermo-electric circuit: If a circuit<br>
is formed of two metals with the junctions at indefinitely near<br>
temperatures, t and t + dt, and dE is the E. M. F. of the circuit, then<br>
the differential coefficient dE/dt is called the thermo-electric power<br>
of the two metals for the temperature t.<br>

Thus the relative E. M. F. of a bismuth-nickel couple, as both are in<br>
the + column, would be 25 - 5 = 20; that of a cobalt-iron couple, one<br>
being in the + column the other in the - column, would be 9 + 5.2 =<br>
14.2. Alloys are not always intermediate to their constituents, and<br>
small amounts of impurities affect the results largely. This may account<br>
for the discrepancies of different observers. Other compounds could be<br>
introduced into the series.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Thermo-electric Thermometer.</span><br>
A species of differential thermometer. It consists of two<br>
thermo-electric junctions connected in opposition with a galvanometer in<br>
the circuit. Any inequality of temperature in the two ends or junctions<br>
produces a current shown by the galvanometer. It may be used to<br>
determine the temperature of a distant place, one of the junctions being<br>
located there and the other being under control of the operator. If the<br>
latter junction is heated until no current is produced its temperature<br>
is evidently equal to that of the distant couple or junction. The<br>
heating may be done with hot water or mercury, or other melted metal.<br>
The temperature of the water, or other substance, gives the temperature<br>
of the distant place.<br>

coils maybe electrically balanced against each other. On exposing one to<br>
a source of heat, its resistance will change and it will disturb the<br>

An apparatus for reproducing sounds telephonically by the agency of<br>
heat; a receiving telephone actuated by heat. Thus a wire may be<br>
attached to the centre of a diaphragm and kept in tension therefrom, and<br>
the transmitting telephone current may be caused to pass through it. The<br>
wire changes in temperature and consequently in length with the pulses<br>
of current going through it and vibrates the diaphragm, reproducing the<br>
sound. It is to be distinguished from the thermo-electric telephone<br>
which involves the action of potential difference produced by<br>

<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Thermostat, Electric.</span><br>
A thermostat or apparatus, similar to a thermometer in some cases, for<br>
closing an electric circuit when heated. It is used in connection with<br>
automatic fire alarms to give warning of fire. For this use a<br>
temperature of 52&deg; C. (125&deg; F.) is an approved one for setting
one at,<br>
to complete the circuit. It is also applied to regulation of<br>
temperature, as in incubators.<br>
<br>
(a) One kind of thermostat consists of a compound bar wound into a<br>
spiral and fastened at one end, to which a terminal of a circuit is<br>
connected. The bar may be made of two strips of brass and iron riveted<br>
together, and wound into a spiral. When such a bar is submitted to<br>
changes of temperature it bends in different directions, because brass<br>
expands and contracts more under changes of temperature than does iron.<br>
A contact point, to which the other terminal is connected, is arranged<br>
to make contact with the spiral at any desired degree of temperature,<br>
thus closing an electric circuit and ringing a bell, opening or closing<br>
a damper, or doing anything else to notify an attendant or to directly<br>
change the temperature.<br>
<br>
If the brass forms the outside of the spiral, increase of temperature<br>
makes the bending of the spiral bring the coils still closer. If the<br>
brass forms the inside, increase of temperature makes the spiral tend to<br>
become less close. As shown in the cut, the brass should lie along the<br>
inside of the spiral.<br>
<br>
Sometimes a straight compound bar is used, one of whose ends is fastened<br>
and the other is free. As the temperature changes such a bar curves more<br>
or less, its free end moving to and fro. Two contact screws are<br>
provided, one on each side of its free end. If the temperature falls it<br>
makes contact with one of these; if the temperature rises, it makes<br>
contact with the other. Thus it may close one of two circuits, one for a<br>
fall and the other for a rise in temperature.<br>
<br>
It is well to introduce a third bar between the brass and iron ones,<br>
made of some material of intermediate coefficient of expansion.<br>
<br>
(b) Another kind of thermostat comprises a vessel of air or other gas,<br>
which, expanding by heat, actuates a piston or other device and closes<br>
an electric circuit. Synonym--Electro-pneumatic Thermostat.<br>
<br>
(c) Another form utilizes the expansion of mercury. The mercury is made<br>
part of an open electric circuit. As it expands it comes in contact with<br>
the other terminal of the circuit, thus completing it, when the current<br>
gives an alarm or does as is provided for in the apparatus employed.<br>
<br>
Thermostats may be worked on either open or closed circuits; normally<br>
the circuit may be open as described and may close on rise of<br>
temperature, or it may be normally closed and open as the temperature<br>
rises.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Thomson Effect.</span><br>
In an unequally heated conductor the differential heating is either<br>
increased as in iron, or diminished as in copper by a current. In lead<br>
the phenomenon does not occur. It is termed the Thomson effect. It is<br>
intimately related to the Peltier effect.<br>
<br>
In a thermo-electric couple a heated junction is the source of<br>
electro-motive force, if heated more than other parts of the circuit.<br>
The current in a copper-iron junction flows from the copper to the iron<br>
across the heated junction. A hot section of an iron conductor next to a<br>
cold section of the same is a source of thermoelectricity, in the sense<br>
that the hot section is negative to the colder. A current passing from<br>
the hot to the cold iron travels against rising potentials, and cools<br>
the iron in the cooler parts. As it passes to the hotter parts it<br>
travels against falling potentials and hence heats the iron in these<br>
parts. In this way a current intensifies differential heating in an iron<br>
conductor.<br>
<br>
In copper the reverse obtains. In it the thermo-electric relations of<br>
hot and cold copper are the reverse of those of iron, and a current<br>
tends to bring all parts of a differentially heated copper conductor to<br>
an identical temperature.<br>
<br>
As a current travels in iron from hot to cold it absorbs heat; in copper<br>
traveling from cold to hot it absorbs heat.<br>
<br>
The convection of heat by a current of electricity in unequally heated<br>
iron is negative, for it is opposed to that convection of heat which<br>
would be brought about by the flow of water through an unequally heated<br>
tube. In copper, on the other hand, the electric convection of heat is<br>
positive. (Daniell.)<br>
<br>
The above effects of the electric current upon an unequally heated<br>
conductor are termed the Thomson effects. In iron, at low red heat, they<br>
are reversed and are probably again reversed at higher temperatures.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Three Wire System.</span><br>
A system of distribution of electric current for multiple arc or<br>
constant potential service. It is the invention of Thomas A. Edison.<br>
<br>
It includes three main wires which start from the central station or<br>
generating plant, and ramify with corresponding reduction in size,<br>
everywhere through the district or building to be lighted. As ordinarily<br>
carried out when dynamos are used, the dynamos are arranged in groups of<br>
two. One lateral lead starts from the negative binding post of one<br>
dynamo. The positive terminal of this dynamo connects to the negative of<br>
the other. Between the two dynamos the central or neutral lead is<br>
connected. The other lateral lead starts from the positive binding post<br>
of the second dynamo.<br>
<br>
The lamps or other appliances are calculated for the potential<br>
difference of a single dynamo. They are arranged between the neutral<br>
wire and the laterals, giving as even a disposition as possible to the<br>
two laterals.<br>
<br>

Fig. 336. DIAGRAM OF THREE WIRE SYSTEM <br>
SHOWING NEUTRAL WIRE.<br>
<br>
<br>
If evenly arranged and all burning or using current, no current goes<br>
through the neutral wire. If all the lamps situated on one lateral are<br>
on open circuit all the current goes through the neutral wire. In other<br>
cases the neutral wire receives the excess of current only.<br>
<br>
The advantages of the system are that it uses smaller wire than the two<br>
wire system for lamps of the same voltage. If lamps of double the<br>
voltage were used the two wire system would be most economical.<br>
<br>
<br>
540&nbsp;&nbsp; STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.<br>
<br>
<br>
Four wire and five wire systems have been more or less used, based on<br>
identical considerations, and involving in each case the coupling of<br>
three or of four dynamos respectively, or else employing a dynamo with<br>
special armature connections to give the requisite three-fold or<br>
four-fold division of total potential. In the five wire system the total<br>
voltage is four times that of a single lamp, the lamps are arranged four<br>
in series across the leads and the central wire is the only one that can<br>
be considered a neutral wire. When lamps are burning entirely from three<br>
side-leads they constitute a sort of three wire system by themselves,<br>
and their central wire may for the time be a neutral wire.<br>
<br>
In some of the three wire mains, especially in the larger sizes, the<br>
neutral wire is made of much smaller section than that of a lateral<br>
conductor, because in extensive districts it is practically impossible<br>
that the current should be concentrated in the neutral wire.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Throw.</span><br>
In a galvanometer the instantaneous deflection of the needle when the<br>

Bearings to support the end-thrust or push of a shaft. In disc armatures<br>
where the field-magnets attract the armatures in the direction of their<br>
axis of rotation, thrust-bearings have to be provided. In ordinary<br>
cylinder or drum armatures end-thrust is not applied, as a little end<br>
motion to and fro is considered advantageous as causing more even wear<br>
of the commutator surface.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Thunder.</span><br>
The violent report which, as we hear it, succeeds the lightning flash in<br>
stormy weather. It is really produced simultaneously with the lightning<br>
and is supposed to arise from disturbance of the air by the discharge.<br>
The rolling noise has been attributed to successive reflections between<br>
clouds and earth, and to series of discharges reaching the ear from<br>
different distances and through air of varying density. The subject is<br>
obscure. By timing the interval from lightning flash to the report of<br>
the thunder an approximate estimate of the distance of the seat of<br>
discharge can be made. The first sound of the thunder should be timed.<br>
An almost concurrence of thunder and lightning indicates immediate<br>
proximity of the discharge.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Time Constant.</span><br>
(a) When current is first turned into a circuit of considerable<br>
self-induction it is resisted rather by the inductance than by the<br>
resistance. It is governed by the ratio of resistance and self-induction<br>
and this factor represents the time which it takes for the current to<br>
reach a definite fraction of its final strength. This fraction is<br>
(2.7183 - 1)/2.7183&nbsp; or 0.63. 2.7183 is the base of the Napierian
system<br>
of logarithms. Thus if in any circuit we divide the inductance in<br>
henries by the resistance in ohms, the ratio gives the time-constant of<br>
the circuit, or it expresses the time which it will take for the current<br>
to reach 0.63 of its final value.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Tongue of Polarized Relay, Bias of.</span><br>
In a Siemens' polarized relay the pole pieces are adjustable so that<br>
they may be brought nearer to or withdrawn from the tongue. One of the<br>
poles is adjusted so as to be nearer the tongue. This one-sided<br>
adjustment is the bias. Its effect is that when the relay is unexcited<br>
this pole attracts the armature so that it normally is drawn towards it.<br>
This ensures the normal contact of the tongue either with the contact<br>
point, or with the insulated stop piece or adjustment screw. Without<br>
bias the armature remains in contact with or drawn towards whichever<br>
pole it was last attracted to. In its usual use a bias is given it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Top, Magnetic.</span><br>
A toy illustrating magnetic attraction. It consists of a disc or body of<br>
lead or other material, through which a magnetized steel spindle pointed<br>
at its lower end is thrust. A number of short pieces of iron wire are<br>
used with it. It is spun like an ordinary top upon the point of the<br>
spindle and one of the pieces of iron wire is laid by the side of its<br>
point. As it turns the magnetic adherence causes the piece of wire to be<br>
carried along in one direction by the rotation of the spindle, until the<br>
end is reached, when it goes over to the other side of the spindle and<br>
travels back again.<br>
<br>
By using bent pieces of wire of various shapes the most curious effects<br>
are produced. Circles and S shaped pieces give good effects. To increase<br>
the mysterious effect covered iron wire (bonnet wire) may be employed.<br>

(a) A fish, the Raia Torpedo, which possesses the power of giving<br>
electric shocks. (See Ray, Electric.)<br>

(b) An instrument of war; a torpedo whose operations include electrical<br>
discharge or other electric function or factor of operation.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Torpedo, Sims-Edison.</span><br>
A torpedo driven by an electric motor, and also steered by electricity.<br>
Its motions are all controlled from the shore. The torpedo proper is<br>
carried some distance below the surface of the water by a vessel<br>
immediately above it, from which it is suspended by two rigid bars. In<br>
the torpedo is a cable reel on which the conducting cable is disposed.<br>
An electric motor and controlling gear are also contained within the<br>
torpedo. In its front the explosive is placed. It is driven by a screw<br>
propeller actuated by the electric motor. As it moves it pays out cable<br>
so that it has no cable to draw after it through the water, the cable<br>
lying stationary in the water behind it. This avoids frictional<br>
resistance to its motion. The maintenance of the torpedo at a proper<br>
depth is one of the advantages of the system.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Torque.</span><br>
A force tending to produce torsion around an axis. An example is the<br>
pulling or turning moment of an armature of an electric motor upon its<br>
shaft. It is often expressed as pounds of pull excited at the end of a<br>
lever arm one foot long.<br>
<br>
The expression is due to Prof. James Thompson, then of the University of<br>
Glasgow.<br>
<br>
"Just as the Newtonian definition of force is that which produces or<br>
tends to produce motion (along a line), so torque may be defined as that<br>
which produces or tends to produce torsion (around an axis). It is<br>
better to use a term which treats this action as a single definite<br>
entity than to use terms like 'couple' and 'moment,' which suggest more<br>
complex ideas." (S. P. Thompson.)<br>
<br>
A force, acting with radius r gives a torque equal to f X r ;&nbsp; f
and r <br>
may be expressed in any units. S. P. Thompson gives the following <br>
equivalents :<br>
<br>
To reduce<br>
&nbsp; dyne-centimeters to gram centimeters, divide by&nbsp;&nbsp; 981<br>
&nbsp; dyne-centimeters to meter-kilograms&nbsp;&nbsp; divide
by&nbsp;&nbsp; 981E5<br>
&nbsp; dyne-centimeter, to
pound-feet&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; divide
by&nbsp;&nbsp; 13.56E6<br>
&nbsp; pound-feet to
meter-kilograms&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; divide
by&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.23<br>
<br>
In each of these compound units the first unit is the force and the<br>
second unit is the radius or lever arm of the torque.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Torsion Balance, Coulomb's.</span><br>
Originally an apparatus in which electrostatic attraction or repulsion<br>
is measured against the torsion of a filament, often of silk-worm cocoon<br>
fibre. It consists in one form of a cylindrical glass vessel in which a<br>
light shellac needle is suspended horizontally by a fibre. This needle<br>
carries at one end a gilded disc or sphere and is suspended by a fine<br>
wire, or filament. A proof plane, q. v., is excited by touching it to<br>
the body under trial; it is then inserted in the case. The disc on the<br>
needle is first attracted and then repelled. The position finally taken<br>
by the needle is noted. The force of torsion thus produced is determined<br>
by twisting the filament by the torsion head on the top of the apparatus<br>
so as to move the needle a certain distance towards the proof plane. The<br>
more the torsion-head has to be turned to carry the needle through a<br>
specified arc the greater is the torsion effected or the greater is the<br>
repulsion exerted, The torsional force of a wire is proportional to the<br>
angle of torsion; this gives the basis for the measurement.<br>
<br>
With magnetic needle it is used to measure magnetic repulsion and<br>
attraction. The best material for the filament is quartz, but the<br>
instrument is not very much used.<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Torsion Galvanometer.</span><br>
A galvanometer in which the torsion required to bring the index back to<br>
zero, when the current tends to displace it, is made the measure of the<br>
current strength or of the electro-motive force. It involves the use of<br>
a torsion head, q. v., or its equivalent.<br>
<br>
<br>
545&nbsp;&nbsp; STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Torsion Head.</span><br>
The handle and disc from whose undersurface the filament depends to<br>
which the needle or magnet is attached. It is turned to measure the<br>
torsional effect, the edge of the disc being marked or graduated so as<br>
to give the angle of deflection required to overcome the effect of the<br>
torque of the needle.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Torsion Suspension.</span><br>
Suspension by one or more wires, fibres, or ribands, involving the<br>
restitutive force of torsion. Thus fibre suspension, q. v., is a variety<br>
of torsion suspension.<br>
<br>
Often a single riband of steel stretched horizontally and secured at<br>
both ends is used, the suspended object, e. g., a balance beam, being<br>
attached at its own centre to the centre of the stretched riband. Quite<br>
sensitive balances are constructed on this principle. It is peculiarly<br>
available where an electric current is to be transmitted, as absolute<br>
contact is secured, as in William Thomson's ampere balances.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Touch.</span><br>
A term applied to methods of magnetization, as "single touch," "double<br>
touch," or "separate touch," indicating how the poles of the inducing<br>
magnet or magnets are applied to the bar to be magnetized. Under the<br>
titles of Magnetization the different methods are described.<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Tourmaline.</span><br>
A mineral; a subsilicate; characterized by the presence of boric<br>
trioxide, which replaces aluminum oxide. It is notable for possessing<br>
pyro-electric properties. (See Pyro-electricity.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Tower, Electric.</span><br>
The tower used in the tower system, q. v., of arc light illumination.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Tower System.</span><br>
In electric lighting the system of lighting extended areas by powerful<br>
arc lamps placed on high towers, generally of iron or steel frame-work.<br>
The lights are thus maintained at a high elevation, giving greater<br>
uniformity of illumination than if they were lower, but at the expense<br>
of considerable light which is lost. Sometimes wooden masts are employed<br>
instead of towers.<br>
<br>
The principle involved is that the intensity of light at any place given<br>
by a source of illumination varies with the square of its distance from<br>
the place in question. Hence in using strong arc lights it is an object<br>
to have the distances of all parts of the area illuminated at as nearly<br>
uniform distances from the light as possible. An approximation to<br>
uniformity is secured by placing the lamps at a very high elevation.<br>
<br>

<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Transformer.</span><br>
In alternate current lighting the induction coil by which the primary<br>
current with high initial electro-motive force is caused to produce a<br>
secondary current with low initial electromotive force.<br>
<br>
A typical transformer consists of a core of thin iron sheets. The<br>
primary is of comparatively thin wire and often of ten or more times as<br>
many turns as the secondary. The latter is of thicker wire. Where the<br>
ratio of 10 to 1 as regards number of turns in the primary and secondary<br>
obtains, the initial E. M. F. of the secondary is one-tenth that of the<br>
primary circuit.<br>
<br>
The cores are laminated, as described, to avoid the formation of<br>
Foucault currents.<br>
<br>
The counter-electro-motive force of the transformer when the secondary<br>
circuit is open, prevents any but the slightest current from passing<br>
through the primary. In proportion as the secondary is closed and its<br>
resistance diminished, as by lighting more lamps in parallel, the<br>
counter-electro-motive force of the transformer falls and more current<br>
passes through the primary.<br>
<br>
<br>

Fig. 339. FERRANTI'S TRANSFORMER.<br>
<br>
The economy of the apparatus is in the fact that counter-electromotive<br>
force reduces current through a conductor without absorbing any energy.<br>
A resistance coil cuts down a current, but absorbs energy equal to the<br>
current multiplied by the potential difference between the terminals of<br>
the coil. This electric energy is converted into heat energy and is<br>
wasted. But the counter-electromotive force of a transformer is exerted<br>
to reduce current without production of heat and with little waste of<br>
energy. This is one of the advantages of the alternating current system<br>
of distribution of electric energy.<br>
<br>
The object of a transformer being to secure safety to the person or to<br>
life by the separation of the high potential primary or street circuit,<br>
and the low potential house circuit, any contact of the two circuits in<br>
the converter is a source of danger. Special care should be taken to<br>
ensure absence of leakage, as it is termed. Mica or other insulation is<br>
sometimes employed to prevent the wires from coming in contact by<br>
piercing or sparking with the core and with each other.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Transformer, Commuting.</span><br>
A type of continuous current transformer, resembling a dynamo with<br>
armature and field both stationary, but with revolving commutator, by<br>
which the magnetic polarity of a double wound armature is made to<br>
rotate. This secures the desired action, of a change or lowering of<br>
potential.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Transformer, Continuous Alternating.</span><br>
An apparatus for transforming a continuous into an alternating current<br>
or the reverse. The combination of a continuous current dynamo with an<br>
alternating current one is sometimes employed. It is a form of motor<br>
dynamo.<br>
<br>
Another type is a regular dynamo with ordinary commutator and with, in<br>
addition thereto, two, three or four contact rings, connecting to as<br>
many symmetrically disposed points in the winding of the armature. This<br>
will give out or receive alternating currents of two, three or four<br>
phases according to the number of collecting rings. One winding serves<br>
for both alternating and continuous currents.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Transformer, Continuous Current.</span><br>
A machine of the dynamo type for changing the potential of a circuit. In<br>
one form two armatures are mounted on one shaft in a single field or in<br>
separate fields; one is a motor armature driven by the original current;<br>
the other generates the new current. This is a motor dynamo. In 1874<br>
Gramme constructed a machine with ring armature with two windings, of<br>
coarse and fine wire respectively, and with independent commutators.<br>
Such dynamo could transform currents up or down.<br>
<br>
Continuous current transformers have attained an efficiency of 83 per<br>
cent. at full load, and of 75 per cent. at half load. Owing to the<br>
balancing of the self-inductions of the two windings these machines do<br>
not spark. As the driven and driving parts are contained in one rotating<br>
part their friction is very slight.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Transformer, Core.</span><br>
A transformer wound upon an enclosed core, such as the hedgehog<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Transformer, Hedgehog.</span><br>
An induction coil transformer whose iron core is composed of a bundle of<br>
iron wires, which after the wire windings are in place have their ends<br>
spread out to reduce to some extent the reluctance of the circuit, which<br>
at the best is high, as the air acts as the return circuit.<br>
<br>
This transformer has a low degree of hysteresis; and its efficiency for<br>
very small loads or for no load is superior to that of the closed<br>
magnetic circuit transformer.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Transformer, Shell.</span><br>
A transformer with its iron core entirely outside of and enclosing the<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Transformer, Welding.</span><br>
The transformer used for electric welding. (See Welding, Electric.) It<br>
is a transformer with very long primary and exceedingly short and thick<br>
secondary. It is used with the alternating current in the primary, and<br>
produces in the secondary circuit which includes the bars to be welded a<br>
very low potential difference.<br>
<br>
Owing to the very low resistance of the secondary circuit this low<br>
electro-motive force produces a very strong current, which develops the<br>
requisite heat. The same type of transformer is used for brazing and<br>
similar purposes.<br>

A grooved metallic pulley or set of pulleys which runs along an active<br>
wire of a circuit, a lead from which trolley goes to earth or connects<br>
with another wire, so that the trolley takes current generally for<br>
operating a street car motor placed upon the circuit leading from it; a<br>
rolling contact with an electric lead.<br>
<br>
Trolleys are principally used on electric railroads, and are now<br>
universally of the sub-wire system, being at the end of a pole which is<br>
inclined backward and forced upward by springs, so as to press the<br>
trolley against the bottom of the wire. Thus the trolley does not<br>
increase the sagging of the wire, but tends to push it up a little in<br>

discharge of electricity takes place along the conductor a row of bright<br>
sparks is produced at the breaks in the conductor. These by reflection<br>
are multiplied apparently, and a beautiful effect of intersecting or<br>

A braid woven of tissue or worsted, and tubular or hollow. Its object is<br>
to provide a covering which can be drawn over joints in covered wires.<br>
In making the joint the ends of the wires are necessarily bared, and a<br>
short piece of tubular braid is used for covering them. It is drawn by<br>

<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Turns.</span><br>
An expression applied to the convolutions of wire in a solenoid,<br>
electro-magnet, or other apparatus or construction of that kind. A turn<br>
indicates a complete encircling of the core or axis of the object. Thus<br>
a wire wound five times around a bar gives five turns.<br>
<br>
While this is its primary meaning the term if compounded may refer to<br>
virtual turns. Thus an ampere-turn means one ampere passing through one<br>
turn. But ten ampere-turns may mean ten amperes passing through ten<br>
turns, five amperes passing through two turns, and so on. This use is<br>
analogous to a dimension of length in a compound word, as foot-pound.<br>
<br>
[Transcriber's note: "But ten ampere-turns may mean ten amperes passing<br>
through ONE turn or one ampere through ten turns, and so on."]<br>
<br>
There may be a number of kinds of turns qualified by descriptive<br>
adjectives, as series-turns, the turns of wire in a series circuit of a<br>
compound dynamo. In the same way there are shunt-turns. If series<br>

The ampere-turns in a primary circuit of an induction coil or<br>
transformer. In an electric welding transformer, or in the transformer<br>
used in the alternating current system, where efficiency is an important<br>
element, the ampere-turns in primary and secondary for an efficiency of<br>
100 per cent. should be equal. In the case of an experimental induction<br>
coil other considerations outweigh that of mere efficiency. Insulation,<br>
including security from piercing, and the production of as long a spark<br>
as possible, are, in these cases, the controlling consideration.<br>
<br>
[Transcriber's note: A 100 per cent efficient transformer is impossible,<br>
but over 99 per cent is common. At room temperature there is always some<br>
lost flux, eddy currents and resistive losses.]<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Turns, Secondary Ampere-.</span><br>
The ampere-turns on the secondary circuit of an induction coil or<br>

negligible inductance, such as a number of incandescent lamps would<br>
provide, the ampere-turns should be equal to those of the primary coil.<br>

A typewriter in which the work of printing or of pressing the type faces<br>

attraction. The keys close electric circuits, throwing the<br>
electro-magnetic action into play. This involves the use of electricity<br>
for what is ordinarily only a mechanical process. The strength of the<br>

Gas so rarefied that its molecules do not collide or very rarely do so.<br>
<br>
Experiments of very striking nature have been devised by Crookes and<br>
others to illustrate the peculiar phenomena that this matter presents.<br>
The general lines of this work are similar to the methods used in<br>
Geissler tube experiments, except that the vacua used are very much<br>
higher.<br>
<br>
When the vacuum is increased so that but one-millionth of the original<br>
gas is left the radiant state is reached. The molecules in their kinetic<br>
movements beat back and forth in straight lines without colliding, or<br>
with very rare collisions. Their motions can be guided and rendered<br>
visible by electrification. A tube or small glass bulb with platinum<br>
electrodes sealed in it, is exhausted to the requisite degree and is<br>
hermetically sealed by melting the glass. The electrodes are connected<br>
to the terminals of an induction coil or other source of high tension<br>
electrification. The molecules which come in contact with a negatively<br>
electrified pole are repelled from it in directions normal to its<br>
surface. They produce different phosphorescent or luminous effects in<br>
their mutual collisions.<br>
<br>
Thus if they are made to impinge upon glass, diamond or ruby, intense<br>
phosphorescence is produced. A piece of platinum subjected to molecular<br>
bombardment is brought to white heat. A movable body can be made to move<br>
under their effects. Two streams proceeding from one negative pole repel<br>
each other. The stream of molecules can be drawn out of their course by<br>
a magnet.<br>

The experiments are all done on a small scale in tubes and bulbs,<br>
resembling to a certain extent Geissler tubes.<br>

field by the action of the machine itself; the former the spontaneous<br>
loss of charge on open circuit or from other cause.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Underground Conductor.</span><br>
An electric conductor insulated and placed under the surface of the<br>
earth, as distinguished from aerial conductors.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Underground Electric Subway.</span><br>
A subway for the enclosing of electric telegraph and other conductors<br>
under the surface, generally in the line of streets, to do away with<br>
telegraph poles and aerial lines of wire. Many systems have been<br>
devised. The general type includes tubes called ducts in sets, called<br>
conduits, bedded in concrete or otherwise protected. Every two or three<br>
hundred feet the sets lead into a cistern-like cavity called a manhole.<br>
The insulated wires or cables, generally sheathed with a lead alloy are<br>
introduced into the tubes through the man-holes. A rope is first fed<br>
through the tube. To do this short rods which screw together are<br>
generally employed. One by one they are introduced, and each end one is<br>
screwed to the series of rods already in the duct. When the end of the<br>
duct is reached the rope is fastened to the last rod, and the rods are<br>
then drawn through, unscrewed one by one and removed, the rope following<br>
them. By means of the rope a windlass or capstan may be applied to draw<br>
the cable into the duct. At least at every second man-hole the cables<br>
have to be spliced.<br>
<br>
Each cable may contain a large number of conductors of small size for<br>
telephoning, or a smaller number for electric light and power. The<br>
tendency is now to separate the different classes of wires in important<br>
lines, placing the heavier wires on one side of the street and the<br>
telephone and telegraph wires on the other. This of course necessitates<br>
two separate conduits.<br>
<br>
The advantage of underground distribution affects not only the<br>
appearance of streets in doing away with unsightly telegraph poles, but<br>
it also removes an element of danger at fires. Aerial wires interfere<br>
greatly with the handling of ladders at fires, and expose the firemen<br>
who attempt to cut them to danger to their lives from shock.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Unidirectional. adj.</span><br>
Having one direction as a "unidirectional current" or "unidirectional<br>
leak." The term is descriptive, and applicable to many cases.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Uniform. adj.</span><br>
Unvarying; as a uniform potential difference, uniform current or<br>
conductor of uniform resistance per unit of length. The term is<br>
descriptive, and its application and meaning are obvious.<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Uniform Field of Force.</span><br>
A field of evenly distributed force; one in which the number of lines of<br>
force per unit of area of any equipotential surface is the same.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Unipolar. adj.</span><br>
Strictly speaking this term means having only one pole, and is applied<br>
to magnets, armatures and the like. In its use a solecism is involved,<br>
for there is no such condition possible as unipolar magnetism or<br>
distribution of magnetism. An example of its use is shown in unipolar<br>
magnets. (See Magnet, Unipolar.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Unipolar Armature.</span><br>
An armature of a unipolar dynamo; an armature whose windings<br>
continuously cut the lines of force about the one pole, and hence whose<br>
polarity is unchanged in its rotation.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Unipolar Current Induction.</span><br>
Current induction produced by moving a conductor through a magnetic<br>
field of force so that it always cuts the lines in similar relation to<br>
itself. Thus it produces a constant current through its own circuit, if<br>
a closed one, and no commutator is required. As this case always in<br>
practice amounts to the cutting of lines of force in the neighborhood of<br>
a single pole the term unipolar is employed to designate the action.<br>
<br>
The simplest representation of unipolar induction is the rotating of a<br>
conductor around the end of a bar magnet, its axis of rotation<br>
corresponding with the axis of the magnet.<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Unipolar Dynamo.</span><br>
A dynamo in which one part of the conductor slides on or around the<br>
magnet, so as always to cut lines of force near the same pole of the<br>
magnet.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Unit.</span><br>
A directly or indirectly conventional and arbitrary quantity, in terms<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Unit, Absolute.</span><br>
A unit based on the three fundamental units of length, mass and time.<br>
These units are the centimeter, gram and second. Each one in itself may<br>
be termed a fundamental absolute unit. The system of such units is<br>
termed the centimeter-gram-second system.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Unit, Angle.</span><br>
A factor or datum in angular velocity, q. v. It is the angle subtended<br>
by a portion of the circumference equal in length to the radius of the<br>
circle. It is equal very nearly to 57.29578&deg; or 57&deg; 17' 44.8".<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Unit, B. A.</span><br>
This term, while logically applicable to any of the British Association<br>
units, is often restricted to the ohm as formerly defined by the British<br>
Association, the B. A. Unit of Resistance, q. v.<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Unit, Fundamental.</span><br>
The three units of length, mass and time, the centimeter, gram and<br>
second, are termed fundamental units. On them is based the absolute<br>
system of units, and on multiples of them the practical system of units.<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Unit Jar.</span><br>
A Leyden jar which is used as a unit of measure of charge.<br>
<br>
It consists of a Leyden jar about 4 inches long and 3/4 inch diameter,<br>
with about 6 square inches of its outer and the same of its inner<br>
surface coated with tinfoil. It is placed between a source of<br>
electricity and a larger jar or battery of jars which is to be charged.<br>
The inner coating connects with the machine; the outer coating with the<br>
jars to be charged. Short conductors terminating in knobs connect with<br>
inner and outer coatings, and the knobs are adjusted at any desired<br>
distance apart.<br>
<br>
By the charging operation the large jar or battery of jars receives a<br>
charge by induction, and the charge of the small jar is at first equal<br>
to this quantity. After a while a spark passes from knob to knob,<br>
discharging the small jar. This indicates the reception by the large<br>
jars of the quantity of electricity represented by the charge of the<br>
small jar. The charging goes on, and for every spark approximately the<br>
same quantity of electricity is received by the larger jars.<br>
<br>
The sparking distance m is directly proportional to the quantity of<br>
electricity, and inversely proportional to the area of coated surface,<br>
or is proportional to the potential difference of the two coats. This is<br>
only true for short sparking distance, hence for accuracy the knobs<br>
should be adjusted not too far from each other.<br>

<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Units, Circular.</span><br>
A system of units of cross-sectional area, designed especially for use<br>
in describing wire conductors. The cross-sectional area of such is<br>
universally a circle, and the areas of two wires of different sizes vary<br>
with the square of their radii or diameters. Hence if the area of a<br>
circle of known diameter is determined it may be used as a unit for the<br>
dimensions of other circles. Any other circle will have an area<br>
proportioned to the area of the unit circle, as the squares of the<br>
diameters are to each other.<br>
<br>
In practise the commonest circular unit is the circular mil. This is the<br>
area of a circle one mil, 1/1000 inch, in diameter and is equal to<br>
.0000007854 square inch. A wire two mils in diameter has an area of four<br>
circular mils; one ten mils in diameter has an area of one hundred<br>
circular mils.<br>
<br>
Thus if the resistance of a given length of wire 1 mil in diameter is<br>
stated, the corresponding resistance of the same length of wire of the<br>
same material, but of other diameter, is given by dividing the first<br>
wire's resistance by the square of the diameter in mils of the wire in<br>
question.<br>
<br>
As it is a basic unit, most conveniently applied by multiplication, the<br>
smaller units are used; these are the circular mil, and circular<br>
millimeter.<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Units, Derived.</span><br>
Units derived by compounding or other processes, from the three<br>
fundamental units. Such are the units of area, volume, energy and work,<br>
momentum and electric units generally. In some cases the dimensions of<br>
the derived unit may reduce to those of a simple unit as inductance<br>
reduces to length, but the unit, as deduced from the fundamental ones,<br>
is still a derived unit.<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Units, Practical.</span><br>
A system of units employed in practical computation. The absolute units,<br>
especially in electricity, have been found too large or too small, and<br>
the attempt to make them more convenient has resulted in this system. It<br>
is based on exactly the same considerations as the absolute system of<br>
units, except that multiples of the original fundamental units of<br>
length, mass, and time have been taken as the base of the new system.<br>
These basic units are multiples of the fundamental units. They are the<br>
following: The unit of length is 1E9 centimeters; the unit of mass is<br>
1E-11 gram; the unit of time remains 1 second.<br>
<br>
While this has conduced to convenience in giving better sized units,<br>
micro- and mega-units and other multiples or fractions have to be used.<br>
The following are the principal practical electric units:<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Universal Battery System.</span><br>
A term in telegraphy. If several equal and high resistance telegraphic<br>
circuits are connected in parallel with each other from terminal to<br>
terminal of a battery of comparatively low resistance each circuit will<br>
receive the same current, and of practically the same strength as if<br>
only one circuit was connected. This is termed the universal battery<br>
system. It is a practical corollary of Ohm's law. The battery being of<br>
very low resistance compared to the lines the joining of several lines<br>
in parallel practically diminishes the total resistance of the circuit<br>
in proportion to their own number. Thus suppose a battery of ten ohms<br>
resistance and ten volts E. M. F. is working a single line of one<br>
hundred ohms resistance. The total resistance of the circuit is then one<br>
hundred and ten ohms. The total current of the circuit, all of which is<br>
received by the one line is 10/110 = .09 ampere, or 90 milliamperes. Now<br>
suppose that a second line of identical resistance is connected to the<br>
battery in parallel with the first. This reduces the external resistance<br>
to fifty ohms, giving a total resistance of the circuit of sixty ohms.<br>
The total current of the circuit, all of which is received by the two<br>
lines in equal parts, is 10/60 = .166 amperes. But this is equally<br>
divided between two lines, so that each one receives .083 ampere or 83<br>
milliamperes; practically the same current as that given by the same<br>
battery to the single line. It will be seen that high line resistance<br>
and low battery resistance, relatively speaking, are required for the<br>
system. For this reason the storage battery is particularly available.<br>
The rule is that the resistance of the battery shall be less than the<br>
combined resistance of all the circuits worked by it.<br>
<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Unmarked End.</span><br>
The south-seeking pole of a magnet, so called because the other end,<br>
called the marked end, is usually marked with a scratch or notch by the<br>
maker, while the south pole is unmarked.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Vacuum.</span><br>
A space destitute of any substance. The great pervading substance is in<br>
general sense the atmosphere. It is the gaseous mixture which surrounds<br>
and envelopes the earth and its inhabitants. It consists of a simple<br>
mixture of oxygen, 1 part, nitrogen, 4 parts, with 4 to 6 volumes of<br>
carbonic acid gas in 10,000 volumes of air, or about one cubic inch to<br>
one cubic foot. It presses with a force of about 14.7 lbs. per square<br>
inch under the influence of the force of gravity. The term vacuum in<br>
practise refers to any space from which air has been removed. It may be<br>
produced chemically. Air may be displaced by carbonic acid gas and the<br>
latter may be absorbed by caustic alkali or other chemical. The air may<br>
be expelled and the space may be filled with steam which is condensed to<br>
produce the vacuum. Of course in all cases the space must be included in<br>
an hermetically sealed vessel, such as the bulb of an incandescent lamp.<br>
But the universal method of producing a vacuum is by air pumps. An<br>
absolute vacuum means the entire absence of gas or air, something almost<br>
impossible to produce. A high vacuum is sometimes understood to mean one<br>
in which the path of the molecules is equal in length to the diameter of<br>
the containing vessels, as in Crookes' Radiometer and other apparatus<br>
for illustrating the radiant condition of matter. The air left after<br>
exhaustion is termed residual air or residual atmosphere.<br>
<br>
[Transcriber's note: Dry air is about .78 nitrogen, .21 oxygen, .01<br>
argon, .00038 carbon dioxide, and trace amounts of other gases. Argon<br>
was suspected by Henry Cavendish in 1785. It was discovered in 1894 by<br>
Lord Rayleigh and Sir William Ramsay.]<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Vacuum, Absolute.</span><br>
A space free of all material substance. It is doubtful whether an<br>
absolute vacuum has ever been produced.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Vacuum, High.</span><br>
An approximate vacuum, so nearly perfect that the molecules of the<br>
residual gas in their kinetic motions rarely collide, and beat back and<br>
forth between the walls of the containing vessel, or between any solid<br>
object contained in the vessel and the walls of the vessel. The gas in<br>
such a vacuum is in the radiant or ultra-gaseous state. (See<br>
Ultra-gaseous Matter.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Vacuum, Low.</span><br>
A vacuum inferior to a high vacuum; a vacuum in which the molecules<br>
collide with each other and do not move directly from side to side of<br>
the containing vessel.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Vacuum, Partial.</span><br>
A space partially exhausted of air so as to contain less than an equal<br>
volume of the surrounding atmosphere. It really should come below a low<br>
vacuum, but is often treated as synonymous therewith.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Vacuum, Torricellian.</span><br>
The vacuum existing above the mercurial column in a barometer tube. The<br>
principle of this vacuum is applied in the Geissler and other air pumps.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Valency.</span><br>
The relative power of replacing hydrogen or combining therewith<br>
possessed by different elements; the number of atomic bonds belonging to<br>
any element. Thus oxygen has a twofold valency, is bivalent or is a<br>
dyad, and combines with two atoms of hydrogen because the latter has a<br>
unitary atomicity, is monovalent or is a monad.<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Valve, Electrically Controlled.</span><br>
A valve which is moved by or whose movements are regulated by<br>
electricity.<br>
<br>
In the block system of railroad signaling the semaphores are worked by<br>
weights and pneumatic cylinders and pistons. The valves for admitting or<br>
releasing the compressed air are operated by coil and plunger mechanism.<br>
There are many other instances of the control of valves by the electric<br>
current.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Vapor Globe.</span><br>
A protecting glass globe surrounding an incandescent lamp, when the lamp<br>
is to be used in an atmosphere of explosive vapor, as in mines or<br>
similar places; or when in a place where it is exposed to dripping water<br>
which would break the hot lamp bulb if it fell upon it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Variable Period.</span><br>
The period of adjustment when a current is started through a conductor<br>
of some capacity. It is the period of duration of the variable state, q.<br>
v., in a conductor. As indicated in the next definition in a cable of<br>
high electrostatic capacity a variable period of nearly two minutes may<br>
exist. This indicates the retardation in signaling to be anticipated in<br>
cables and other lines of high capacity.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Variable State.</span><br>
When an electric circuit is closed the current starts through the<br>
conductor with its full strength from the point of closure, and advances<br>
with a species of wave front so that some time elapses before it attains<br>
its full strength in the most distant parts of the conductor, owing to<br>
its having to charge the conductor to its full capacity at the given<br>
potential. The state of the line while the current thus varies is called<br>
the variable state.<br>
<br>
A long telegraph line when a message is being transmitted may be always<br>
in the variable state. The current at the receiving end may never attain<br>
its full strength.<br>
<br>
In the case of such a conductor as the Atlantic cable, 108 seconds would<br>
be required for a current to attain 9/10 of its full strength at the<br>
distant end, and but 1/5 second to attain 1/100 of its final value.<br>
During the period of increase of current the variable state exists.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Variation of the Compass.</span><br>
The declination of the magnetic needle. (See Elements, Magnetic.) As the<br>
declination is subject to daily, annual and secular variations, it is<br>
unfortunate that this term is synonymous with declination. Thus the<br>
variation of the compass means its declination, while there is also the<br>
variation of the declination and of other elements. The term variation<br>
of the compass is more colloquial than the more definite expression<br>
"declination," or "magnetic declination."<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Varley's Condenser.</span><br>
A static condenser whose conducting surfaces are platinum electrodes<br>
immersed in dilute sulphuric acid. When the potential difference is<br>
1/50th that of a Daniell's cell, two square inches of platinum have a<br>
capacity equal to that of an air condenser whose plates have an area of<br>
80,000,000 square inches, and separated 1/8th of an inch from each<br>
other. As the E. M. F. increases the capacity also increases.<br>

desired.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Varnish.</span><br>
A glossy transparent coating of the nature of paint, applied as a<br>
protective, or ornamental coating to objects.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Varnish, Electric.</span><br>
Alcoholic or etherial varnishes are the best for electrical apparatus.<br>
They dry quickly and perfectly, and tend to form surfaces unfavorable to<br>
the hygroscopic collection of water. Sealing wax dissolved in alcohol,<br>
or shellac dissolved in the same solvent are used for electrical<br>
apparatus, although the first is rather a lacquer than a varnish.<br>
Etherial solution of gum-copal is used to agglomerate coils of wire. It<br>
is well to bake varnished objects to harden the coating.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Varnish, Red.</span><br>
A solution of sealing wax in 90 per cent. alcohol. It is best made thin<br>
and applied in several coats, each coat being allowed to dry perfectly<br>
before the next is applied. It is often seen on Leyden jars. It is a<br>
protector from surface leakage.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Vat.</span><br>
A vessel for chemical or other solutions. A depositing vat is one in<br>
which a plating solution is worked, for the deposition of electroplate<br>
upon articles immersed in the liquid, and electrolyzed by an electric<br>
current.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Velocity.</span><br>
The rate of motion of a body. It is usually expressed in distance<br>
traversed per second of time. The absolute unit is one centimeter per<br>
second or kine. The foot per second is very largely used also.<br>
<br>
The dimensions of velocity are length (L) divided by time (T) or L/T.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Velocity, Angular.</span><br>
Velocity in a circle defined by the unit angle, or the angle which<br>
subtends a circular arc equal in length to itself. The radius of the<br>
circle traversed by the moving body does not enter into this definition,<br>
as the real velocity of the object is not stated. If its angular<br>
velocity and the radius of the path it travels are given its actual<br>
velocity can be deduced.<br>
<br>
<br>
560&nbsp;&nbsp; STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Velocity of Signaling.</span><br>
The speed of transmission of electric signals is affected by the nature<br>
of the line, as regards its static capacity, and by the delicacy of the<br>
receiving instruments, which may need a more or less strong current to<br>
be affected. Thus of an original current one per cent. may suffice to<br>
operate a sensitive instrument. This might give almost the velocity of<br>
light, while if the instrument would only respond to the full current<br>
nearly two minutes (see Variable State) might be required for the<br>
production of a signal.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Velocity Ratio.</span><br>
A term applied to the ratios existing between the electrostatic and<br>
electro-magnetic units. If we take as numerators the dimensions of the<br>
different qualities in the electrostatic system, and their dimensions in<br>
the electro-magnetic system as denominators, the fractions thus obtained<br>
reduce to expressions containing only velocity or V in some form. Thus<br>
if we divide the dimensions of the electrostatic quantity by the<br>
dimensions of electro-magnetic quantity the quotient is simply V or<br>
velocity. A like division for potential, electrostatic and<br>
electro-magnetic gives (1/V), and so on.<br>
<br>
The value of the velocity ratio is very nearly 3E10 (sometimes given as<br>
2.98E10) centimeters per second. This is almost exactly that of light<br>
(2.9992E10 centimeters per second.) This is one of the proofs of Clerk<br>
Maxwell's magnetic theory of light. (See Maxwell's Theory of Light.)<br>
<br>
[Transcriber's note: The SI metre was defined in 1983 such that the<br>
speed of light in a vacuum is exactly 299,792,458 metres per second or<br>
about 186,282.397 miles per second.]<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Ventilation of Armature.</span><br>
In a dynamo or motor ventilation of the armature is often provided for<br>
by apertures through it in order to prevent heating. This heating is<br>
caused by Foucault currents. By proper disposition of the interior of<br>
the armature with properly disposed vanes and orifices an action like<br>
that of a fan blower can be produced, which by creating a current of air<br>
cools the machine very efficiently.<br>

either of them.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Vibration Period.</span><br>
In electrical resonance the period of a vibration in an electrical<br>
resonator. The length of this period indicates the quality of the<br>
resonator in responding to electrical oscillations by sympathetic<br>
vibration. For conductors of small resistance the period is thus<br>
calculated. Let T be the period of one-half a full vibration; L the<br>
absolute coefficient of self-induction expressed in centimeters or in<br>
henries X 10-9; C the electrostatic capacity of the terminals, also<br>
expressed in the same unit; v the velocity of light in centimeters per<br>
second. Then we have the formula<br>
<br>
&nbsp; T = PI * SquareRoot( L * C ) / v<br>
<br>
[Transcriber's note: If the inductance is in henries and the capacitance<br>
in farads, frequency in hertz = 1/(2 * PI * squareRoot( L * C ) )]<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Vibration, Sympathetic.</span><br>
A vibration in a cord or other body susceptible of elastic vibration<br>
produced by the vibrations of exactly the same period in a neighboring<br>
vibrating body. Thus if two tuning forks are tuned to precisely the same<br>
pitch, and are placed near each other, if one is sounded it will start<br>
the other into vibration by sympathy.<br>
<br>
In electricity its application is found in electric resonance<br>
experiments. The resonator has a definite period of electric resonance,<br>
and is made to give a spark by the exciter of identical period. This is<br>
by what may be called electric sympathetic vibration, and is exactly<br>
analogous to the action of the tuning forks upon each other.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Vibrator, Electro-magnetic.</span><br>
The make and break mechanism used on induction coils, or other similar<br>
apparatus in which by alternate attractions by and releases from an<br>
electro-magnet an arm or spring is kept in motion. In most cases the<br>
work is done by a single magnet, whose armature is attracted to the<br>
magnet, when the latter is excited, but against the action of a spring<br>
which tends to pull it away from the magnet. In its motions a make and<br>
break action is produced, to give the requisite alternations of<br>
attraction and release. Two electro-magnets may be connected so as<br>
alternately to be excited and keep an arm carrying a mutual armature in<br>
vibration, or the same result may be attained by a polarized relay. The<br>
make and break is illustrated under Bell, Electric--Coil, Induction--<br>
Anvil.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Villari's Critical Value.</span><br>
Magnetization induced or residual in a wire is diminished on stretching,<br>
provided that the magnetization corresponds to an inducing force above a<br>
certain critical value, known as above; this being (Sir Wm. Thomson)<br>
about 24 times the terrestrial intensity. Below that critical value<br>
tension increases the magnetization of a magnetized wire. The effects of<br>
transverse expansive stress are opposed to those of longitudinal<br>
stretching. (Daniell.)<br>

<br>
It has not been very widely accepted, the tendency among photometrists<br>
being to adhere to the old standards, carcel or candle. It is obvious<br>
that actual use of the Viole would be very inconvenient and would<br>
involve expensive apparatus, difficult to work with.<br>

<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Voltaic Effect.</span><br>
The potential difference developed by contact of different conductors.<br>
It is the basis of the contact theory, q. v., of electricity, although<br>
it may be accepted as the expression for a condition of things by those<br>
who reject the above theory. This potential difference is slight when<br>
the conductors are separated, but it is calculated that it would be<br>
enormous could the metals be so quickly separated as to hold each its<br>
own charge.<br>
<br>
Thus if a copper and a zinc plate are assumed to be in contact, really<br>
1/20000000 centimeter or 1/50000000 inch apart, they may be treated as a<br>
pair of condenser plates. Being so near, their density of charge, which<br>
is a strongly bound charge, is enormous. If it were possible to separate<br>
them without permitting any discharge, their potential would rise by the<br>
separation, on the principle of Epinus' condenser, q. v., to such an<br>
extent that they would spark through twenty feet of air. (See Volta's<br>

A voltameter whose indications are based on the electrolysis of water,<br>

are measured. It may take several forms.<br>
<br>
In one form it is an apparatus consisting of a single eudiometer or<br>
graduated glass tube with upper end closed and its lower end or mouth<br>
open, collecting the mixture of hydrogen and oxygen.<br>
<br>
In the form shown in the cut three tubes are connected, the side tubes<br>
representing eudiometers. For each side tube there is a platinum<br>
electrode. In this apparatus the oxygen and hydrogen are connected in<br>
opposite tubes. A is an open tube filled with dilute sulphuric acid. By<br>
opening the cocks on B and C they can both be completely filled with<br>
acid. As shown in the cut, this operation is not yet completed. The<br>
hydrogen alone may in this case be measured.<br>
<br>
The mixed gas voltameter has only one eudiometer.<br>
<br>
The exact equivalents are only approximately known. The volume of mixed<br>
gases per coulomb is given as .1738 cubic centimeters (Ayrton); .172<br>
cubic centimeters (Hospitalier); and other values by other authorities.<br>
The hydrogen is equal to 1/3 of the mixed gases almost exactly.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Voltameter, Silver.</span><br>
An apparatus consisting of a platinum vessel containing a solution of<br>
silver nitrate into which solution a silver anode dips, whose end is<br>
wrapped in muslin to prevent the detachment of any particles. When a<br>
current is passed by connecting one terminal to the dish and the other<br>
to the rod, securing a proper direction of current, silver will be<br>
deposited on the dish and the same amount will be dissolved from the<br>
rod. The dish is weighed before and after the test. Its increase in<br>
weight gives the silver deposited.<br>

the dish rests and which also serves as a conductor and contact surface,<br>
b is a muslin cloth to place over the silver plate to prevent detached<br>
particles falling in the dish; s s' are the binding screws.<br>
<br>
The weight of silver corresponding to a coulomb is given variously by<br>
different authorities. Ayrton and Daniell take 1.11815 milligrams or<br>
.017253 grain of metallic silver. Other determinations are as follows:<br>
&nbsp; 1.1183 milligrams&nbsp;&nbsp; (Kohlrausch).<br>
&nbsp; 1.124&nbsp;&nbsp;
"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(Merscart).<br>
<br>
The solution of silver nitrate should be from 15 to 30 per cent. of<br>
strength. The current should not exceed one ampere per six square<br>
inches; or in other words not more than about 3/1000 grain of silver<br>
should be deposited per second on a square inch area of the dish. The<br>
edge of the silver disc or anode should be about equidistant from the<br>
side and bottom of the dish. The latter notes are due to Lord Rayleigh.<br>

An instrument for determining the potential difference of any two<br>
points.<br>
<br>
In many cases it is a calibrated galvanometer wound with a coil of high<br>
resistance. The object to be attained is that it shall receive only an<br>
insignificant portion of current and that such portion shall suffice to<br>
actuate it. If connected in parallel with any portion of a circuit, it<br>
should not noticeably diminish its resistance.<br>
<br>
The divisions into which ammeters range themselves answer for<br>
voltmeters. In practice the same construction is adopted for both. The<br>
different definitions of ammeters in disclosing the general lines of<br>
these instruments are in general applicable to voltmeters, except that<br>
the wire winding of the coils must be of thin wire of great length. The<br>
definitions of ammeters may be consulted with the above understanding<br>
for voltmeters.<br>
<br>
In the use made of voltmeters there is a distinction from ammeters. An<br>
ammeter is a current measurer and all the current measured must be<br>
passed through it. But while a voltmeter is in fact a current measurer,<br>
it is so graduated and so used that it gives in its readings the<br>
difference of potential existing between two places on a circuit, and<br>
while measuring the current passing through its own coils, it is by<br>
calibration made to give not the current intensity, but the<br>
electro-motive force producing such current.<br>
<br>
In use it may be connected to two terminals of an open circuit, when as<br>
it only permits an inconsiderable current to pass, it indicates the<br>
potential difference existing between such points on open circuit. Or it<br>
may be connected to any two parts of a closed circuit. Owing to its high<br>
resistance, although it is in parallel with the intervening portion of<br>
the circuit, as it is often connected in practice, it is without any<br>
appreciable effect upon the current. It will then indicate the potential<br>
difference existing between the two points.<br>

<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Voltmeter, Cardew.</span><br>
A voltmeter in which the current passing through its conductor heats<br>
such conductor, causing it to expand. Its expansion is caused to move an<br>
index needle. By calibration the movements of the needle are made to<br>
correspond to the potential differences producing the actuating currents<br>
through it. The magnetic action of the current plays no part in its<br>
operation. It is the invention of Capt. Cardew, R. E.<br>
<br>
The construction of the instrument in one of its most recent forms is<br>
shown in the cut. On each side of the drum-like case of the instrument<br>
are the binding screws. These connect with the blocks m and n. To these<br>
the fine wire conductor is connected and is carried down and up over the<br>
two pulleys seen at the lowest extremity, its centre being attached to<br>
c. From c a wire is carried to the drum p, shown on an enlarged scale on<br>
the left of the cut. A second wire from the same drum or pulley connects<br>
to the spring S. The winding of the two wires is shown in the separate<br>
figure of c, where it is seen that they are screwed fast to the<br>
periphery of the little drum, and are virtually continuations of each<br>
other. By the screw A the tension of the spring S is adjusted.<br>
<br>
On the shaft of the little drum p is a pinion, which works into the<br>
teeth of the cog-wheel r. The shaft of r is extended through the dial<br>
of the instrument, and carries an index. The dial is marked off for<br>
volts; g g and h h are standards for carrying the pulleys.<br>
<br>
<br>
570&nbsp;&nbsp; STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.<br>
<br>
<br>
The action of the instrument is as follows. The current passing through<br>
the wire heats it. This current by Ohm's law is proportional to the<br>
electro-motive force between the terminals. As it is heated it expands<br>
and as it cools contracts, definite expanding and contracting<br>
corresponding to definite potential differences. As the wire expands and<br>
contracts the block or pin c moves back and forth, thus turning the drum<br>
p and cogwheel r one way or permitting it to turn the other way under<br>
the pull of the spring S.<br>

<br>
In this construction for a given expansion of the wire the piece c only<br>
moves one half as much. The advantage of using a wire twice as long as<br>
would be required for the same degree of movement were the full<br>
expansion utilized is that a very thin wire can be employed. Such a wire<br>
heats and cools more readily, and hence the instrument reaches its<br>
reading more quickly or is more deadbeat, if we borrow a phraseology<br>
properly applicable only to instruments with oscillating indexes.<br>

If the potential difference to be measured lies between 30 and 120 volts<br>
the wire as described suffices. But to extend the range of the<br>
instrument a resistance in series is required. If such resistance is<br>
double that of the instrument wire, and remains double whether the<br>
latter is hot or cold the readings on the scale will correspond to<br>
exactly twice the number of volts. This is brought about in some<br>
instruments by the introduction in series of a duplicate wire, precisely<br>
similar to the other wire, and like it, carried around pulleys and kept<br>
stretched by a spring.<br>
<br>
[Transcriber's note: If the series resistance is twice that of the<br>
voltmeter, the indicated voltage will be ONE THIRD of the total<br>
voltage.]<br>
<br>
Thus whatever ratio of resistance exists between the two wires cold, it<br>
is always the same at any temperature, as they both increase in<br>
temperature at exactly the same rate. Tubes are provided to enclose the<br>
stretched wires and pulleys, which tubes are blackened.<br>
<br>
The voltmeter is unaffected by magnetic fields, and, as its<br>
self-induction is very slight, it is much used for alternating currents.<br>
The tubes containing the wire may be three feet long.<br>
<br>
Its disadvantages are thus summarized by Ayrton. It absorbs a good deal<br>
of energy; it cannot be constructed for small potential differences, as<br>
the wire cannot be made thicker, as it would make it more sluggish;<br>
there is vagueness in the readings near the zero point and sometimes<br>
inaccuracy in the upper part of the scale.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Volts, Lost.</span><br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Voltmeter, Electrostatic.</span><br>
A voltmeter based on the lines of the quadrant electrometer. It includes<br>
two sets of quadrants, each oppositely excited by one of the two parts,<br>
whose potential difference is to be determined. They attract each other<br>
against a controlling force as of gravity.<br>
<br>
One form has the two sets poised on horizontal axes, bringing the parts<br>
so that the flat quadrants move in vertical planes.<br>
<br>
In another form a number of quadrants are used in each set, the members<br>
of the two sets alternating with each other. One set is fixed, the<br>
others move and carry the index.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Vulcanite.</span><br>
Vulcanized india rubber which by high proportion of sulphur and proper<br>
vulcanization has been made hard. It is sometimes distinguished from<br>
ebonite as being comparatively light in color, often a dull red, while<br>
ebonite is black. For its electrical properties see Ebonite.<br>
<br>
Both substances have their defects, in producing surface leakage.<br>
Washing with weak ammonia, or with dilute soda solution, followed by<br>
distilled water, is recommended for the surface, if there is any trouble<br>
with surface leakage. It may also be rubbed over with melted paraffine<br>
wax.<br>

(a) The practical unit of electric activity, rate of work, or rate of<br>
energy. It is the rate of energy or of work represented by a current of<br>
one ampere urged by one volt electro-motive force; the volt-ampere.<br>
<br>
It is the analogue in electricity of the horse power in mechanics;<br>
approximately, 746 watts represent one electric horse power.<br>
<br>
Ohm's law, taken as C = E/R, gives as values for current, C and E/R, and<br>
for electro- motive force C R. In these formulas, C represents current<br>
strength, R represents resistance and E represents electro-motive force.<br>
Then a watt being the product of electro-motive force by current<br>
strength, we get the following values for rate of electric energy, of<br>
which the watt is the practical unit: (1) E2/R -- (2) C*E -- (3) C2 * R.<br>
<br>
<br>
The equivalents of the watt vary a little according to different<br>
authorities. Ayrton gives the following equivalents: 44.25 foot pounds<br>
per minute--.7375 foot pounds per second--1/746 horse power. These<br>
values are practically accurate. Hospitalier gives .7377 foot pounds per<br>
second. Hering gives .737324 foot pounds per second, and 1000/745941<br>
horse power.<br>

<br>
The current process is carried out by pressing together the objects to<br>
be united, while holding them in conducting clamps. A heavy current is<br>
turned on by way of the clamps and rapidly heats the metals at the<br>
junction, which is of course the point of highest resistance. As the<br>
metal softens, it is pressed together, one of the clamps being mounted<br>
with feed motion, flux is dropped on if necessary, and the metal pieces<br>
unite.<br>
<br>
The most remarkable results are thus attained; almost all common metals<br>
can be welded, and different metals can be welded together. Tubes and<br>
other shapes can also be united. In many cases the weld is the strongest<br>
part.<br>
<br>
<br>
575&nbsp;&nbsp; STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.<br>
<br>
<br>
The alternating current is employed. A special dynamo is sometimes used<br>
to produce it. This dynamo has two windings on the armature. One is of<br>
fine wire and is in series with the field magnets and excites them. The<br>
other is of copper bars, and connects with the welding apparatus, giving<br>
a current of high intensity but actuated by low potential.<br>
<br>
Where the special dynamo is not used, an induction coil or transformer<br>
is used. The primary includes a large number of convolutions of<br>
relatively fine wire; the secondary may only be one turn of a large<br>
copper bar.<br>
<br>
The cut shows in diagram an electric welding coil. P is the primary coil<br>
of a number of turns of wire; S S is the secondary, a single copper bar<br>
bent into an almost complete circle. It terminates in clamps D D for<br>
holding the bars to be welded. B C, B' C are the bars to be welded. They<br>
are pressed together by the screw J. The large coil I of iron wire<br>
surrounding the coils represents the iron core.<br>
<br>
The real apparatus as at present constructed involves many<br>
modifications. The diagram only illustrates the principle of the<br>
apparatus.<br>
<br>
In welding by the voltaic arc the place to be heated is made an<br>
electrode of an arc by connection with one terminal of an electric<br>
circuit. A carbon is connected to the other terminal. An arc is started<br>
by touching and withdrawal of the carbon. The heat may be used for<br>
welding, soldering, brazing, or even for perforating or dividing metal<br>
sheets.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Wheatstone's Bridge.</span><br>
A system of connections applied to parallel circuits, including<br>
resistance coils for the purpose of measuring an unknown resistance. A<br>
single current is made to pass from A through two parallel connected<br>
branches, joining together again at C. A cross connection B D has a<br>
galvanometer or other current indicator in circuit. In any conductor<br>
through which a current is passing, the fall of potential at given<br>
points is proportional to the resistance between such points. Referring<br>
to the diagram a given fall of potential exists between A and C. The<br>
fall between A and B is to the fall between A and C as the resistance r<br>
between A and B is to the resistance r + r' between A and C. The same<br>
applies to the other branch, with the substitution of the resistances s<br>
and S' and the point D for r r' and B. Therefore, if this proportion<br>
holds, r : r' : : s : S'. No current will go through B D , and the<br>
galvanometer will be unaffected. Assume s' to be of unknown resistance,<br>
the above proportion will give it, if r, r' and s are known, or if the<br>
ratio of r to r' and the absolute value of s is known.<br>
<br>
<br>
576&nbsp;&nbsp; STANDARD ELECTRICAL DICTIONARY.<br>
<br>
<br>
In use the resistances r, r', and s are made to vary as desired. To<br>
measure an unknown resistance it is introduced at S', and one of the<br>
other resistances is varied until the galvanometer is unaffected. Then<br>
the resistance of S' is determined by calculation as just explained. The<br>
artificial resistances may be resistance coils, q. v., or it is enough<br>
to have one unknown resistance at s. Then if the length of wire ABC is<br>
accurately known, the point B can be shifted along it until the balance<br>
is attained. The relative lengths A B, and B C, will then give the ratio<br>
r : r' needed for the calculation. This assumes the wire ABC to be of<br>
absolutely uniform resistance. This is the principle of the meter-bridge<br>
described below. The use of coils is the more common method and is<br>
carried out by special resistance boxes, with the connections arranged<br>
to carry out the exact principle as explained. The principle of<br>
construction and use of a resistance box of the Wheatstone bridge type,<br>
as shown in the cut, is described under Box Bridge, q. v.<br>

The object of compound winding is to make a self-regulating dynamo and<br>
this object is partly attained for a constant speed.<br>
<br>
The characteristic curves of shunt and series winding are of opposite<br>
natures. The first increases in electro-motive force for resistance in<br>
the outer circuit, the latter decreases under the same conditions. If<br>
the windings are so proportioned that these conditions for each one of<br>

A variety of duplex telegraphy in which the messages are sent from<br>
opposite ends of the line, simultaneously, so as to be transmitted in<br>
opposite directions. (See Working, Diplex.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Working, Diplex.</span><br>
In duplex telegraphy the sending of two independent messages from the<br>
same end of the line in the same direction.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Working, Double Curb.</span><br>
A method of working telegraph lines. When a signal is sent the line is<br>
charged. This has to be got rid of, and is an element of retardation. In<br>
double curb working it is disposed of by sending a momentary current<br>
first in the reverse, and then in the same, and finally in the reverse<br>
direction. This is found to reduce the charge to a very low point.<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Working, Hexode.</span><br>
In multiplex telegraphy the transmission of six messages simultaneously<br>
over one wire. (See Telegraphy, Multiplex.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Working, Pentode.</span><br>
In multiplex telegraphy the transmission of five messages simultaneously<br>
over one wire. (See Telegraphy, Multiplex.)<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Working, Reverse Current.</span><br>
A method of telegraphy, in which the currents are reversed or alternated<br>
in direction.<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Working, Single Curb.</span><br>
A simpler form of telegraph signaling than double curb working. It<br>
consists in sending a reverse current through the line for each signal<br>
by reversing the battery connection.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Working, Tetrode.</span><br>
In multiplex telegraphy the transmission of four messages simultaneously<br>
over the same line. (See Telegraphy, Multiplex.)<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Zamboni's Dry Pile.</span><br>
A voltaic pile or battery. It is made of discs of paper, silvered or<br>
tinned on one side and sprinkled on the other with binoxide of<br>
manganese. Sometimes as many as 2,000 of such couples are piled up in a<br>
glass tube and pressed together with two rods which form the terminals.<br>
They maintain a high potential difference, but having very high<br>
resistance and slight polarization capacity, give exceedingly small<br>
quantities.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Zero.</span><br>
(a) The origin of any scale of measurement.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Zero, Absolute.</span><br>
From several considerations it is believed that at a certain temperature<br>
the molecules of all bodies would touch each other, their kinetic motion<br>
would cease, and there would be no heat. This temperature is the<br>
absolute zero. It is put at -273&deg; C. (-459&deg; F.)<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Zero, Thermometric.</span><br>
There are three thermometric zeros. In the R&eacute;aumur and centigrade<br>
scales, it is at the temperature of melting ice; in the Fahrenheit<br>
scale, it is 32&deg; F. below that temperature, or corresponds to
-17.78&deg; C.<br>
